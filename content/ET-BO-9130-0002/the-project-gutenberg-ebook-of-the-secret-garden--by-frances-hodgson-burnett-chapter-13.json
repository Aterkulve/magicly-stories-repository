  "content": "<p>“I AM COLIN”</p>\n<p>Mary took the picture back to the house when she went to her supper and she</p>\n<p>showed it to Martha.</p>\n<p>“Eh!” said Martha with great pride. “I never knew our Dickon</p>\n<p>was as clever as that. That there’s a picture of a missel thrush on her</p>\n<p>nest, as large as life an’ twice as natural.”</p>\n<p>Then Mary knew Dickon had meant the picture to be a message. He had meant that</p>\n<p>she might be sure he would keep her secret. Her garden was her nest and she was</p>\n<p>like a missel thrush. Oh, how she did like that queer, common boy!</p>\n<p>She hoped he would come back the very next day and she fell asleep looking</p>\n<p>forward to the morning.</p>\n<p>But you never know what the weather will do in Yorkshire, particularly in the</p>\n<p>springtime. She was awakened in the night by the sound of rain beating with</p>\n<p>heavy drops against her window. It was pouring down in torrents and the wind</p>\n<p>was “wuthering” round the corners and in the chimneys of the huge</p>\n<p>old house. Mary sat up in bed and felt miserable and angry.</p>\n<p>“The rain is as contrary as I ever was,” she said. “It came</p>\n<p>because it knew I did not want it.”</p>\n<p>She threw herself back on her pillow and buried her face. She did not cry, but</p>\n<p>she lay and hated the sound of the heavily beating rain, she hated the wind and</p>\n<p>its “wuthering.” She could not go to sleep again. The mournful</p>\n<p>sound kept her awake because she felt mournful herself. If she had felt happy</p>\n<p>it would probably have lulled her to sleep. How it “wuthered” and</p>\n<p>how the big raindrops poured down and beat against the pane!</p>\n<p>“It sounds just like a person lost on the moor and wandering on and on</p>\n<p>crying,” she said.</p>\n<p>She had been lying awake turning from side to side for about an hour, when</p>\n<p>suddenly something made her sit up in bed and turn her head toward the door</p>\n<p>listening. She listened and she listened.</p>\n<p>“It isn’t the wind now,” she said in a loud whisper.</p>\n<p>“That isn’t the wind. It is different. It is that crying I heard</p>\n<p>before.”</p>\n<p>The door of her room was ajar and the sound came down the corridor, a far-off</p>\n<p>faint sound of fretful crying. She listened for a few minutes and each minute</p>\n<p>she became more and more sure. She felt as if she must find out what it was. It</p>\n<p>seemed even stranger than the secret garden and the buried key. Perhaps the</p>\n<p>fact that she was in a rebellious mood made her bold. She put her foot out of</p>\n<p>bed and stood on the floor.</p>\n<p>“I am going to find out what it is,” she said. “Everybody is</p>\n<p>in bed and I don’t care about Mrs. Medlock—I don’t</p>\n<p>care!”</p>\n<p>There was a candle by her bedside and she took it up and went softly out of the</p>\n<p>room. The corridor looked very long and dark, but she was too excited to mind</p>\n<p>that. She thought she remembered the corners she must turn to find the short</p>\n<p>corridor with the door covered with tapestry—the one Mrs. Medlock had</p>\n<p>come through the day she lost herself. The sound had come up that passage. So</p>\n<p>she went on with her dim light, almost feeling her way, her heart beating so</p>\n<p>loud that she fancied she could hear it. The far-off faint crying went on and</p>\n<p>led her. Sometimes it stopped for a moment or so and then began again. Was this</p>\n<p>the right corner to turn? She stopped and thought. Yes it was. Down this</p>\n<p>passage and then to the left, and then up two broad steps, and then to the</p>\n<p>right again. Yes, there was the tapestry door.</p>\n<p>She pushed it open very gently and closed it behind her, and she stood in the</p>\n<p>corridor and could hear the crying quite plainly, though it was not loud. It</p>\n<p>was on the other side of the wall at her left and a few yards farther on there</p>\n<p>was a door. She could see a glimmer of light coming from beneath it. The</p>\n<p>Someone was crying in that room, and it was quite a young Someone.</p>\n<p>So she walked to the door and pushed it open, and there she was standing in the</p>\n<p>room!</p>\n<p>It was a big room with ancient, handsome furniture in it. There was a low fire</p>\n<p>glowing faintly on the hearth and a night light burning by the side of a carved</p>\n<p>four-posted bed hung with brocade, and on the bed was lying a boy, crying</p>\n<p>fretfully.</p>\n<p>Mary wondered if she was in a real place or if she had fallen asleep again and</p>\n<p>was dreaming without knowing it.</p>\n<p>The boy had a sharp, delicate face the color of ivory and he seemed to have</p>\n<p>eyes too big for it. He had also a lot of hair which tumbled over his forehead</p>\n<p>in heavy locks and made his thin face seem smaller. He looked like a boy who</p>\n<p>had been ill, but he was crying more as if he were tired and cross than as if</p>\n<p>he were in pain.</p>\n<p>Mary stood near the door with her candle in her hand, holding her breath. Then</p>\n<p>she crept across the room, and, as she drew nearer, the light attracted the</p>\n<p>boy’s attention and he turned his head on his pillow and stared at her,</p>\n<p>his gray eyes opening so wide that they seemed immense.</p>\n<p>“Who are you?” he said at last in a half-frightened whisper.</p>\n<p>“Are you a ghost?”</p>\n<p>“No, I am not,” Mary answered, her own whisper sounding half</p>\n<p>frightened. “Are you one?”</p>\n<p>He stared and stared and stared. Mary could not help noticing what strange eyes</p>\n<p>he had. They were agate gray and they looked too big for his face because they</p>\n<p>had black lashes all round them.</p>\n<p>“No,” he replied after waiting a moment or so. “I am</p>\n<p>Colin.”</p>\n<p>“Who is Colin?” she faltered.</p>\n<p>“I am Colin Craven. Who are you?”</p>\n<p>“I am Mary Lennox. Mr. Craven is my uncle.”</p>\n<p>“He is my father,” said the boy.</p>\n<p>“Your father!” gasped Mary. “No one ever told me he had a</p>\n<p>boy! Why didn’t they?”</p>\n<p>“Come here,” he said, still keeping his strange eyes fixed on her</p>\n<p>with an anxious expression.</p>\n<p>She came close to the bed and he put out his hand and touched her.</p>\n<p>“You are real, aren’t you?” he said. “I have such real</p>\n<p>dreams very often. You might be one of them.”</p>\n<p>Mary had slipped on a woolen wrapper before she left her room and she put a</p>\n<p>piece of it between his fingers.</p>\n<p>“Rub that and see how thick and warm it is,” she said. “I</p>\n<p>will pinch you a little if you like, to show you how real I am. For a minute I</p>\n<p>thought you might be a dream too.”</p>\n<p>“Where did you come from?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“From my own room. The wind wuthered so I couldn’t go to sleep and</p>\n<p>I heard someone crying and wanted to find out who it was. What were you crying</p>\n<p>for?”</p>\n<p>“Because I couldn’t go to sleep either and my head ached. Tell me</p>\n<p>your name again.”</p>\n<p>“Mary Lennox. Did no one ever tell you I had come to live here?”</p>\n<p>He was still fingering the fold of her wrapper, but he began to look a little</p>\n<p>more as if he believed in her reality.</p>\n<p>“No,” he answered. “They daren’t.”</p>\n<p>“Why?” asked Mary.</p>\n<p>“Because I should have been afraid you would see me. I won’t let</p>\n<p>people see me and talk me over.”</p>\n<p>“Why?” Mary asked again, feeling more mystified every moment.</p>\n<p>“Because I am like this always, ill and having to lie down. My father</p>\n<p>won’t let people talk me over either. The servants are not allowed to</p>\n<p>speak about me. If I live I may be a hunchback, but I shan’t live. My</p>\n<p>father hates to think I may be like him.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, what a queer house this is!” Mary said. “What a queer</p>\n<p>house! Everything is a kind of secret. Rooms are locked up and gardens are</p>\n<p>locked up—and you! Have you been locked up?”</p>\n<p>“No. I stay in this room because I don’t want to be moved out of</p>\n<p>it. It tires me too much.”</p>\n<p>“Does your father come and see you?” Mary ventured.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes. Generally when I am asleep. He doesn’t want to see</p>\n<p>me.”</p>\n<p>“Why?” Mary could not help asking again.</p>\n<p>A sort of angry shadow passed over the boy’s face.</p>\n<p>“My mother died when I was born and it makes him wretched to look at me.</p>\n<p>He thinks I don’t know, but I’ve heard people talking. He almost</p>\n<p>hates me.”</p>\n<p>“He hates the garden, because she died,” said Mary half speaking to</p>\n<p>herself.</p>\n<p>“What garden?” the boy asked.</p>\n<p>“Oh! just—just a garden she used to like,” Mary stammered.</p>\n<p>“Have you been here always?”</p>\n<p>“Nearly always. Sometimes I have been taken to places at the seaside, but</p>\n<p>I won’t stay because people stare at me. I used to wear an iron thing to</p>\n<p>keep my back straight, but a grand doctor came from London to see me and said</p>\n<p>it was stupid. He told them to take it off and keep me out in the fresh air. I</p>\n<p>hate fresh air and I don’t want to go out.”</p>\n<p>“I didn’t when first I came here,” said Mary. “Why do</p>\n<p>you keep looking at me like that?”</p>\n<p>“Because of the dreams that are so real,” he answered rather</p>\n<p>fretfully. “Sometimes when I open my eyes I don’t believe I’m</p>\n<p>awake.”</p>\n<p>“We’re both awake,” said Mary. She glanced round the room</p>\n<p>with its high ceiling and shadowy corners and dim fire-light. “It looks</p>\n<p>quite like a dream, and it’s the middle of the night, and everybody in</p>\n<p>the house is asleep—everybody but us. We are wide awake.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want it to be a dream,” the boy said restlessly.</p>\n<p>Mary thought of something all at once.</p>\n<p>“If you don’t like people to see you,” she began, “do</p>\n<p>you want me to go away?”</p>\n<p>He still held the fold of her wrapper and he gave it a little pull.</p>\n<p>“No,” he said. “I should be sure you were a dream if you</p>\n<p>went. If you are real, sit down on that big footstool and talk. I want to hear</p>\n<p>about you.”</p>\n<p>Mary put down her candle on the table near the bed and sat down on the</p>\n<p>cushioned stool. She did not want to go away at all. She wanted to stay in the</p>\n<p>mysterious hidden-away room and talk to the mysterious boy.</p>\n<p>“What do you want me to tell you?” she said.</p>\n<p>He wanted to know how long she had been at Misselthwaite; he wanted to know</p>\n<p>which corridor her room was on; he wanted to know what she had been doing; if</p>\n<p>she disliked the moor as he disliked it; where she had lived before she came to</p>\n<p>Yorkshire. She answered all these questions and many more and he lay back on</p>\n<p>his pillow and listened. He made her tell him a great deal about India and</p>\n<p>about her voyage across the ocean. She found out that because he had been an</p>\n<p>invalid he had not learned things as other children had. One of his nurses had</p>\n<p>taught him to read when he was quite little and he was always reading and</p>\n<p>looking at pictures in splendid books.</p>\n<p>Though his father rarely saw him when he was awake, he was given all sorts of</p>\n<p>wonderful things to amuse himself with. He never seemed to have been amused,</p>\n<p>however. He could have anything he asked for and was never made to do anything</p>\n<p>he did not like to do.</p>\n<p>“Everyone is obliged to do what pleases me,” he said indifferently.</p>\n<p>“It makes me ill to be angry. No one believes I shall live to grow</p>\n<p>up.”</p>\n<p>He said it as if he was so accustomed to the idea that it had ceased to matter</p>\n<p>to him at all. He seemed to like the sound of Mary’s voice. As she went</p>\n<p>on talking he listened in a drowsy, interested way. Once or twice she wondered</p>\n<p>if he were not gradually falling into a doze. But at last he asked a question</p>\n<p>which opened up a new subject.</p>\n<p>“How old are you?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I am ten,” answered Mary, forgetting herself for the moment,</p>\n<p>“and so are you.”</p>\n<p>“How do you know that?” he demanded in a surprised voice.</p>\n<p>“Because when you were born the garden door was locked and the key was</p>\n<p>buried. And it has been locked for ten years.”</p>\n<p>Colin half sat up, turning toward her, leaning on his elbows.</p>\n<p>“What garden door was locked? Who did it? Where was the key</p>\n<p>buried?” he exclaimed as if he were suddenly very much interested.</p>\n<p>“It—it was the garden Mr. Craven hates,” said Mary nervously.</p>\n<p>“He locked the door. No one—no one knew where he buried the</p>\n<p>key.”</p>\n<p>“What sort of a garden is it?” Colin persisted eagerly.</p>\n<p>“No one has been allowed to go into it for ten years,” was</p>\n<p>Mary’s careful answer.</p>\n<p>But it was too late to be careful. He was too much like herself. He too had had</p>\n<p>nothing to think about and the idea of a hidden garden attracted him as it had</p>\n<p>attracted her. He asked question after question. Where was it? Had she never</p>\n<p>looked for the door? Had she never asked the gardeners?</p>\n<p>“They won’t talk about it,” said Mary. “I think they</p>\n<p>have been told not to answer questions.”</p>\n<p>“I would make them,” said Colin.</p>\n<p>“Could you?” Mary faltered, beginning to feel frightened. If he</p>\n<p>could make people answer questions, who knew what might happen!</p>\n<p>“Everyone is obliged to please me. I told you that,” he said.</p>\n<p>“If I were to live, this place would sometime belong to me. They all know</p>\n<p>that. I would make them tell me.”</p>\n<p>Mary had not known that she herself had been spoiled, but she could see quite</p>\n<p>plainly that this mysterious boy had been. He thought that the whole world</p>\n<p>belonged to him. How peculiar he was and how coolly he spoke of not living.</p>\n<p>“Do you think you won’t live?” she asked, partly because she</p>\n<p>was curious and partly in hope of making him forget the garden.</p>\n<p>“I don’t suppose I shall,” he answered as indifferently as he</p>\n<p>had spoken before. “Ever since I remember anything I have heard people</p>\n<p>say I shan’t. At first they thought I was too little to understand and</p>\n<p>now they think I don’t hear. But I do. My doctor is my father’s</p>\n<p>cousin. He is quite poor and if I die he will have all Misselthwaite when my</p>\n<p>father is dead. I should think he wouldn’t want me to live.”</p>\n<p>“Do you want to live?” inquired Mary.</p>\n<p>“No,” he answered, in a cross, tired fashion. “But I</p>\n<p>don’t want to die. When I feel ill I lie here and think about it until I</p>\n<p>cry and cry.”</p>\n<p>“I have heard you crying three times,” Mary said, “but I did</p>\n<p>not know who it was. Were you crying about that?” She did so want him to</p>\n<p>forget the garden.</p>\n<p>“I dare say,” he answered. “Let us talk about something else.</p>\n<p>Talk about that garden. Don’t you want to see it?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” answered Mary, in quite a low voice.</p>\n<p>“I do,” he went on persistently. “I don’t think I ever</p>\n<p>really wanted to see anything before, but I want to see that garden. I want the</p>\n<p>key dug up. I want the door unlocked. I would let them take me there in my</p>\n<p>chair. That would be getting fresh air. I am going to make them open the</p>\n<p>door.”</p>\n<p>He had become quite excited and his strange eyes began to shine like stars and</p>\n<p>looked more immense than ever.</p>\n<p>“They have to please me,” he said. “I will make them take me</p>\n<p>there and I will let you go, too.”</p>\n<p>Mary’s hands clutched each other. Everything would be</p>\n<p>spoiled—everything! Dickon would never come back. She would never again</p>\n<p>feel like a missel thrush with a safe-hidden nest.</p>\n<p>“Oh, don’t—don’t—don’t—don’t do</p>\n<p>that!” she cried out.</p>\n<p>He stared as if he thought she had gone crazy!</p>\n<p>“Why?” he exclaimed. “You said you wanted to see it.”</p>\n<p>“I do,” she answered almost with a sob in her throat, “but if</p>\n<p>you make them open the door and take you in like that it will never be a secret</p>\n<p>again.”</p>\n<p>He leaned still farther forward.</p>\n<p>“A secret,” he said. “What do you mean? Tell me.”</p>\n<p>Mary’s words almost tumbled over one another.</p>\n<p>“You see—you see,” she panted, “if no one knows but</p>\n<p>ourselves—if there was a door, hidden somewhere under the ivy—if</p>\n<p>there was—and we could find it; and if we could slip through it together</p>\n<p>and shut it behind us, and no one knew anyone was inside and we called it our</p>\n<p>garden and pretended that—that we were missel thrushes and it was our</p>\n<p>nest, and if we played there almost every day and dug and planted seeds and</p>\n<p>made it all come alive—”</p>\n<p>“Is it dead?” he interrupted her.</p>\n<p>“It soon will be if no one cares for it,” she went on. “The</p>\n<p>bulbs will live but the roses—”</p>\n<p>He stopped her again as excited as she was herself.</p>\n<p>“What are bulbs?” he put in quickly.</p>\n<p>“They are daffodils and lilies and snowdrops. They are working in the</p>\n<p>earth now—pushing up pale green points because the spring is</p>\n<p>coming.”</p>\n<p>“Is the spring coming?” he said. “What is it like? You</p>\n<p>don’t see it in rooms if you are ill.”</p>\n<p>“It is the sun shining on the rain and the rain falling on the sunshine,</p>\n<p>and things pushing up and working under the earth,” said Mary. “If</p>\n<p>the garden was a secret and we could get into it we could watch the things grow</p>\n<p>bigger every day, and see how many roses are alive. Don’t you see? Oh,</p>\n<p>don’t you see how much nicer it would be if it was a secret?”</p>\n<p>He dropped back on his pillow and lay there with an odd expression on his face.</p>\n<p>“I never had a secret,” he said, “except that one about not</p>\n<p>living to grow up. They don’t know I know that, so it is a sort of</p>\n<p>secret. But I like this kind better.”</p>\n<p>“If you won’t make them take you to the garden,” pleaded</p>\n<p>Mary, “perhaps—I feel almost sure I can find out how to get in</p>\n<p>sometime. And then—if the doctor wants you to go out in your chair, and</p>\n<p>if you can always do what you want to do, perhaps—perhaps we might find</p>\n<p>some boy who would push you, and we could go alone and it would always be a</p>\n<p>secret garden.”</p>\n<p>“I should—like—that,” he said very slowly, his eyes</p>\n<p>looking dreamy. “I should like that. I should not mind fresh air in a</p>\n<p>secret garden.”</p>\n<p>Mary began to recover her breath and feel safer because the idea of keeping the</p>\n<p>secret seemed to please him. She felt almost sure that if she kept on talking</p>\n<p>and could make him see the garden in his mind as she had seen it he would like</p>\n<p>it so much that he could not bear to think that everybody might tramp in to it</p>\n<p>when they chose.</p>\n<p>“I’ll tell you what I</p>\n<p>think</p>\n<p>it would be like, if we could go</p>\n<p>into it,” she said. “It has been shut up so long things have grown</p>\n<p>into a tangle perhaps.”</p>\n<p>He lay quite still and listened while she went on talking about the roses which</p>\n<p>might</p>\n<p>have clambered from tree to tree and hung down—about the</p>\n<p>many birds which</p>\n<p>might</p>\n<p>have built their nests there because it was so</p>\n<p>safe. And then she told him about the robin and Ben Weatherstaff, and there was</p>\n<p>so much to tell about the robin and it was so easy and safe to talk about it</p>\n<p>that she ceased to be afraid. The robin pleased him so much that he smiled</p>\n<p>until he looked almost beautiful, and at first Mary had thought that he was</p>\n<p>even plainer than herself, with his big eyes and heavy locks of hair.</p>\n<p>“I did not know birds could be like that,” he said. “But if</p>\n<p>you stay in a room you never see things. What a lot of things you know. I feel</p>\n<p>as if you had been inside that garden.”</p>\n<p>She did not know what to say, so she did not say anything. He evidently did not</p>\n<p>expect an answer and the next moment he gave her a surprise.</p>\n<p>“I am going to let you look at something,” he said. “Do you</p>\n<p>see that rose-colored silk curtain hanging on the wall over the</p>\n<p>mantel-piece?”</p>\n<p>Mary had not noticed it before, but she looked up and saw it. It was a curtain</p>\n<p>of soft silk hanging over what seemed to be some picture.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” she answered.</p>\n<p>“There is a cord hanging from it,” said Colin. “Go and pull</p>\n<p>it.”</p>\n<p>Mary got up, much mystified, and found the cord. When she pulled it the silk</p>\n<p>curtain ran back on rings and when it ran back it uncovered a picture. It was</p>\n<p>the picture of a girl with a laughing face. She had bright hair tied up with a</p>\n<p>blue ribbon and her gay, lovely eyes were exactly like Colin’s unhappy</p>\n<p>ones, agate gray and looking twice as big as they really were because of the</p>\n<p>black lashes all round them.</p>\n<p>“She is my mother,” said Colin complainingly. “I don’t</p>\n<p>see why she died. Sometimes I hate her for doing it.”</p>\n<p>“How queer!” said Mary.</p>\n<p>“If she had lived I believe I should not have been ill always,” he</p>\n<p>grumbled. “I dare say I should have lived, too. And my father would not</p>\n<p>have hated to look at me. I dare say I should have had a strong back. Draw the</p>\n<p>curtain again.”</p>\n<p>Mary did as she was told and returned to her footstool.</p>\n<p>“She is much prettier than you,” she said, “but her eyes are</p>\n<p>just like yours—at least they are the same shape and color. Why is the</p>\n<p>curtain drawn over her?”</p>\n<p>He moved uncomfortably.</p>\n<p>“I made them do it,” he said. “Sometimes I don’t like</p>\n<p>to see her looking at me. She smiles too much when I am ill and miserable.</p>\n<p>Besides, she is mine and I don’t want everyone to see her.”</p>\n<p>There were a few moments of silence and then Mary spoke.</p>\n<p>“What would Mrs. Medlock do if she found out that I had been here?”</p>\n<p>she inquired.</p>\n<p>“She would do as I told her to do,” he answered. “And I</p>\n<p>should tell her that I wanted you to come here and talk to me every day. I am</p>\n<p>glad you came.”</p>\n<p>“So am I,” said Mary. “I will come as often as I can,</p>\n<p>but”—she hesitated—“I shall have to look every day for</p>\n<p>the garden door.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, you must,” said Colin, “and you can tell me about it</p>\n<p>afterward.”</p>\n<p>He lay thinking a few minutes, as he had done before, and then he spoke again.</p>\n<p>“I think you shall be a secret, too,” he said. “I will not</p>\n<p>tell them until they find out. I can always send the nurse out of the room and</p>\n<p>say that I want to be by myself. Do you know Martha?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I know her very well,” said Mary. “She waits on</p>\n<p>me.”</p>\n<p>He nodded his head toward the outer corridor.</p>\n<p>“She is the one who is asleep in the other room. The nurse went away</p>\n<p>yesterday to stay all night with her sister and she always makes Martha attend</p>\n<p>to me when she wants to go out. Martha shall tell you when to come here.”</p>\n<p>Then Mary understood Martha’s troubled look when she had asked questions</p>\n<p>about the crying.</p>\n<p>“Martha knew about you all the time?” she said.</p>\n<p>“Yes; she often attends to me. The nurse likes to get away from me and</p>\n<p>then Martha comes.”</p>\n<p>“I have been here a long time,” said Mary. “Shall I go away</p>\n<p>now? Your eyes look sleepy.”</p>\n<p>“I wish I could go to sleep before you leave me,” he said rather</p>\n<p>shyly.</p>\n<p>“Shut your eyes,” said Mary, drawing her footstool closer,</p>\n<p>“and I will do what my Ayah used to do in India. I will pat your hand and</p>\n<p>stroke it and sing something quite low.”</p>\n<p>“I should like that perhaps,” he said drowsily.</p>\n<p>Somehow she was sorry for him and did not want him to lie awake, so she leaned</p>\n<p>against the bed and began to stroke and pat his hand and sing a very low little</p>\n<p>chanting song in Hindustani.</p>\n<p>“That is nice,” he said more drowsily still, and she went on</p>\n<p>chanting and stroking, but when she looked at him again his black lashes were</p>\n<p>lying close against his cheeks, for his eyes were shut and he was fast asleep.</p>\n<p>So she got up softly, took her candle and crept away without making a sound.</p>\n"
