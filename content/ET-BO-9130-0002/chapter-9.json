  "content": "<p>THE STRANGEST HOUSE ANYONE EVER LIVED IN</p>\n<p>It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place anyone could imagine. The</p>\n<p>high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing</p>\n<p>roses which were so thick that they were matted together. Mary Lennox knew they</p>\n<p>were roses because she had seen a great many roses in India. All the ground was</p>\n<p>covered with grass of a wintry brown and out of it grew clumps of bushes which</p>\n<p>were surely rosebushes if they were alive. There were numbers of standard roses</p>\n<p>which had so spread their branches that they were like little trees. There were</p>\n<p>other trees in the garden, and one of the things which made the place look</p>\n<p>strangest and loveliest was that climbing roses had run all over them and swung</p>\n<p>down long tendrils which made light swaying curtains, and here and there they</p>\n<p>had caught at each other or at a far-reaching branch and had crept from one</p>\n<p>tree to another and made lovely bridges of themselves. There were neither</p>\n<p>leaves nor roses on them now and Mary did not know whether they were dead or</p>\n<p>alive, but their thin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of</p>\n<p>hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass,</p>\n<p>where they had fallen from their fastenings and run along the ground. It was</p>\n<p>this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious. Mary</p>\n<p>had thought it must be different from other gardens which had not been left all</p>\n<p>by themselves so long; and indeed it was different from any other place she had</p>\n<p>ever seen in her life.</p>\n<p>“How still it is!” she whispered. “How still!”</p>\n<p>Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness. The robin, who had</p>\n<p>flown to his treetop, was still as all the rest. He did not even flutter his</p>\n<p>wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary.</p>\n<p>“No wonder it is still,” she whispered again. “I am the first</p>\n<p>person who has spoken in here for ten years.”</p>\n<p>She moved away from the door, stepping as softly as if she were afraid of</p>\n<p>awakening someone. She was glad that there was grass under her feet and that</p>\n<p>her steps made no sounds. She walked under one of the fairy-like gray arches</p>\n<p>between the trees and looked up at the sprays and tendrils which formed them.</p>\n<p>“I wonder if they are all quite dead,” she said. “Is it all a</p>\n<p>quite dead garden? I wish it wasn’t.”</p>\n<p>If she had been Ben Weatherstaff she could have told whether the wood was alive</p>\n<p>by looking at it, but she could only see that there were only gray or brown</p>\n<p>sprays and branches and none showed any signs of even a tiny leaf-bud anywhere.</p>\n<p>But she was</p>\n<p>inside</p>\n<p>the wonderful garden and she could come through the</p>\n<p>door under the ivy any time and she felt as if she had found a world all her</p>\n<p>own.</p>\n<p>The sun was shining inside the four walls and the high arch of blue sky over</p>\n<p>this particular piece of Misselthwaite seemed even more brilliant and soft than</p>\n<p>it was over the moor. The robin flew down from his tree-top and hopped about or</p>\n<p>flew after her from one bush to another. He chirped a good deal and had a very</p>\n<p>busy air, as if he were showing her things. Everything was strange and silent</p>\n<p>and she seemed to be hundreds of miles away from anyone, but somehow she did</p>\n<p>not feel lonely at all. All that troubled her was her wish that she knew</p>\n<p>whether all the roses were dead, or if perhaps some of them had lived and might</p>\n<p>put out leaves and buds as the weather got warmer. She did not want it to be a</p>\n<p>quite dead garden. If it were a quite alive garden, how wonderful it would be,</p>\n<p>and what thousands of roses would grow on every side!</p>\n<p>Her skipping-rope had hung over her arm when she came in and after she had</p>\n<p>walked about for a while she thought she would skip round the whole garden,</p>\n<p>stopping when she wanted to look at things. There seemed to have been grass</p>\n<p>paths here and there, and in one or two corners there were alcoves of evergreen</p>\n<p>with stone seats or tall moss-covered flower urns in them.</p>\n<p>As she came near the second of these alcoves she stopped skipping. There had</p>\n<p>once been a flowerbed in it, and she thought she saw something sticking out of</p>\n<p>the black earth—some sharp little pale green points. She remembered what</p>\n<p>Ben Weatherstaff had said and she knelt down to look at them.</p>\n<p>“Yes, they are tiny growing things and they</p>\n<p>might</p>\n<p>be crocuses or</p>\n<p>snowdrops or daffodils,” she whispered.</p>\n<p>She bent very close to them and sniffed the fresh scent of the damp earth. She</p>\n<p>liked it very much.</p>\n<p>“Perhaps there are some other ones coming up in other places,” she</p>\n<p>said. “I will go all over the garden and look.”</p>\n<p>She did not skip, but walked. She went slowly and kept her eyes on the ground.</p>\n<p>She looked in the old border beds and among the grass, and after she had gone</p>\n<p>round, trying to miss nothing, she had found ever so many more sharp, pale</p>\n<p>green points, and she had become quite excited again.</p>\n<p>“It isn’t a quite dead garden,” she cried out softly to</p>\n<p>herself. “Even if the roses are dead, there are other things</p>\n<p>alive.”</p>\n<p>She did not know anything about gardening, but the grass seemed so thick in</p>\n<p>some of the places where the green points were pushing their way through that</p>\n<p>she thought they did not seem to have room enough to grow. She searched about</p>\n<p>until she found a rather sharp piece of wood and knelt down and dug and weeded</p>\n<p>out the weeds and grass until she made nice little clear places around them.</p>\n<p>“Now they look as if they could breathe,” she said, after she had</p>\n<p>finished with the first ones. “I am going to do ever so many more.</p>\n<p>I’ll do all I can see. If I haven’t time today I can come</p>\n<p>tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>She went from place to place, and dug and weeded, and enjoyed herself so</p>\n<p>immensely that she was led on from bed to bed and into the grass under the</p>\n<p>trees. The exercise made her so warm that she first threw her coat off, and</p>\n<p>then her hat, and without knowing it she was smiling down on to the grass and</p>\n<p>the pale green points all the time.</p>\n<p>The robin was tremendously busy. He was very much pleased to see gardening</p>\n<p>begun on his own estate. He had often wondered at Ben Weatherstaff. Where</p>\n<p>gardening is done all sorts of delightful things to eat are turned up with the</p>\n<p>soil. Now here was this new kind of creature who was not half Ben’s size</p>\n<p>and yet had had the sense to come into his garden and begin at once.</p>\n<p>Mistress Mary worked in her garden until it was time to go to her midday</p>\n<p>dinner. In fact, she was rather late in remembering, and when she put on her</p>\n<p>coat and hat, and picked up her skipping-rope, she could not believe that she</p>\n<p>had been working two or three hours. She had been actually happy all the time;</p>\n<p>and dozens and dozens of the tiny, pale green points were to be seen in cleared</p>\n<p>places, looking twice as cheerful as they had looked before when the grass and</p>\n<p>weeds had been smothering them.</p>\n<p>“I shall come back this afternoon,” she said, looking all round at</p>\n<p>her new kingdom, and speaking to the trees and the rose-bushes as if they heard</p>\n<p>her.</p>\n<p>Then she ran lightly across the grass, pushed open the slow old door and</p>\n<p>slipped through it under the ivy. She had such red cheeks and such bright eyes</p>\n<p>and ate such a dinner that Martha was delighted.</p>\n<p>“Two pieces o’ meat an’ two helps o’ rice</p>\n<p>puddin’!” she said. “Eh! mother will be pleased when I tell</p>\n<p>her what th’ skippin’-rope’s done for thee.”</p>\n<p>In the course of her digging with her pointed stick Mistress Mary had found</p>\n<p>herself digging up a sort of white root rather like an onion. She had put it</p>\n<p>back in its place and patted the earth carefully down on it and just now she</p>\n<p>wondered if Martha could tell her what it was.</p>\n<p>“Martha,” she said, “what are those white roots that look</p>\n<p>like onions?”</p>\n<p>“They’re bulbs,” answered Martha. “Lots o’ spring</p>\n<p>flowers grow from ’em. Th’ very little ones are snowdrops an’</p>\n<p>crocuses an’ th’ big ones are narcissuses an’ jonquils and</p>\n<p>daffydowndillys. Th’ biggest of all is lilies an’ purple flags. Eh!</p>\n<p>they are nice. Dickon’s got a whole lot of ’em planted in our bit</p>\n<p>o’ garden.”</p>\n<p>“Does Dickon know all about them?” asked Mary, a new idea taking</p>\n<p>possession of her.</p>\n<p>“Our Dickon can make a flower grow out of a brick walk. Mother says he</p>\n<p>just whispers things out o’ th’ ground.”</p>\n<p>“Do bulbs live a long time? Would they live years and years if no one</p>\n<p>helped them?” inquired Mary anxiously.</p>\n<p>“They’re things as helps themselves,” said Martha.</p>\n<p>“That’s why poor folk can afford to have ’em. If you</p>\n<p>don’t trouble ’em, most of ’em’ll work away underground</p>\n<p>for a lifetime an’ spread out an’ have little ’uns.</p>\n<p>There’s a place in th’ park woods here where there’s</p>\n<p>snowdrops by thousands. They’re the prettiest sight in Yorkshire when</p>\n<p>th’ spring comes. No one knows when they was first planted.”</p>\n<p>“I wish the spring was here now,” said Mary. “I want to see</p>\n<p>all the things that grow in England.”</p>\n<p>She had finished her dinner and gone to her favorite seat on the hearth-rug.</p>\n<p>“I wish—I wish I had a little spade,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Whatever does tha’ want a spade for?” asked Martha,</p>\n<p>laughing. “Art tha’ goin’ to take to diggin’? I must</p>\n<p>tell mother that, too.”</p>\n<p>Mary looked at the fire and pondered a little. She must be careful if she meant</p>\n<p>to keep her secret kingdom. She wasn’t doing any harm, but if Mr. Craven</p>\n<p>found out about the open door he would be fearfully angry and get a new key and</p>\n<p>lock it up forevermore. She really could not bear that.</p>\n<p>“This is such a big lonely place,” she said slowly, as if she were</p>\n<p>turning matters over in her mind. “The house is lonely, and the park is</p>\n<p>lonely, and the gardens are lonely. So many places seem shut up. I never did</p>\n<p>many things in India, but there were more people to look at—natives and</p>\n<p>soldiers marching by—and sometimes bands playing, and my Ayah told me</p>\n<p>stories. There is no one to talk to here except you and Ben Weatherstaff. And</p>\n<p>you have to do your work and Ben Weatherstaff won’t speak to me often. I</p>\n<p>thought if I had a little spade I could dig somewhere as he does, and I might</p>\n<p>make a little garden if he would give me some seeds.”</p>\n<p>Martha’s face quite lighted up.</p>\n<p>“There now!” she exclaimed, “if that wasn’t one of</p>\n<p>th’ things mother said. She says, ‘There’s such a lot</p>\n<p>o’ room in that big place, why don’t they give her a bit for</p>\n<p>herself, even if she doesn’t plant nothin’ but parsley an’</p>\n<p>radishes? She’d dig an’ rake away an’ be right down happy</p>\n<p>over it.’ Them was the very words she said.”</p>\n<p>“Were they?” said Mary. “How many things she knows,</p>\n<p>doesn’t she?”</p>\n<p>“Eh!” said Martha. “It’s like she says: ‘A woman</p>\n<p>as brings up twelve children learns something besides her A B C.</p>\n<p>Children’s as good as ’rithmetic to set you findin’ out</p>\n<p>things.’”</p>\n<p>“How much would a spade cost—a little one?” Mary asked.</p>\n<p>“Well,” was Martha’s reflective answer, “at Thwaite</p>\n<p>village there’s a shop or so an’ I saw little garden sets with a</p>\n<p>spade an’ a rake an’ a fork all tied together for two shillings.</p>\n<p>An’ they was stout enough to work with, too.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve got more than that in my purse,” said Mary. “Mrs.</p>\n<p>Morrison gave me five shillings and Mrs. Medlock gave me some money from Mr.</p>\n<p>Craven.”</p>\n<p>“Did he remember thee that much?” exclaimed Martha.</p>\n<p>“Mrs. Medlock said I was to have a shilling a week to spend. She gives me</p>\n<p>one every Saturday. I didn’t know what to spend it on.”</p>\n<p>“My word! that’s riches,” said Martha. “Tha’ can</p>\n<p>buy anything in th’ world tha’ wants. Th’ rent of our cottage</p>\n<p>is only one an’ threepence an’ it’s like pullin’</p>\n<p>eye-teeth to get it. Now I’ve just thought of somethin’,”</p>\n<p>putting her hands on her hips.</p>\n<p>“What?” said Mary eagerly.</p>\n<p>“In the shop at Thwaite they sell packages o’ flower-seeds for a</p>\n<p>penny each, and our Dickon he knows which is th’ prettiest ones an’</p>\n<p>how to make ’em grow. He walks over to Thwaite many a day just for</p>\n<p>th’ fun of it. Does tha’ know how to print letters?”</p>\n<p>suddenly.</p>\n<p>“I know how to write,” Mary answered.</p>\n<p>Martha shook her head.</p>\n<p>“Our Dickon can only read printin’. If tha’ could print we</p>\n<p>could write a letter to him an’ ask him to go an’ buy th’</p>\n<p>garden tools an’ th’ seeds at th’ same time.”</p>\n<p>“Oh! you’re a good girl!” Mary cried. “You are, really!</p>\n<p>I didn’t know you were so nice. I know I can print letters if I try.</p>\n<p>Let’s ask Mrs. Medlock for a pen and ink and some paper.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve got some of my own,” said Martha. “I bought</p>\n<p>’em so I could print a bit of a letter to mother of a Sunday. I’ll</p>\n<p>go and get it.”</p>\n<p>She ran out of the room, and Mary stood by the fire and twisted her thin little</p>\n<p>hands together with sheer pleasure.</p>\n<p>“If I have a spade,” she whispered, “I can make the earth</p>\n<p>nice and soft and dig up weeds. If I have seeds and can make flowers grow the</p>\n<p>garden won’t be dead at all—it will come alive.”</p>\n<p>She did not go out again that afternoon because when Martha returned with her</p>\n<p>pen and ink and paper she was obliged to clear the table and carry the plates</p>\n<p>and dishes downstairs and when she got into the kitchen Mrs. Medlock was there</p>\n<p>and told her to do something, so Mary waited for what seemed to her a long time</p>\n<p>before she came back. Then it was a serious piece of work to write to Dickon.</p>\n<p>Mary had been taught very little because her governesses had disliked her too</p>\n<p>much to stay with her. She could not spell particularly well but she found that</p>\n<p>she could print letters when she tried. This was the letter Martha dictated to</p>\n<p>her:</p>\n<p>“</p>\n<p>My Dear Dickon:</p>\n<p>This comes hoping to find you well as it leaves me at present. Miss Mary has</p>\n<p>plenty of money and will you go to Thwaite and buy her some flower seeds and a</p>\n<p>set of garden tools to make a flower-bed. Pick the prettiest ones and easy to</p>\n<p>grow because she has never done it before and lived in India which is</p>\n<p>different. Give my love to mother and everyone of you. Miss Mary is going to</p>\n<p>tell me a lot more so that on my next day out you can hear about elephants and</p>\n<p>camels and gentlemen going hunting lions and tigers.</p>\n<p>“Your loving sister,</p>\n<p>“Martha Phœbe Sowerby.”</p>\n<p>“We’ll put the money in th’ envelope an’ I’ll get</p>\n<p>th’ butcher boy to take it in his cart. He’s a great friend</p>\n<p>o’ Dickon’s,” said Martha.</p>\n<p>“How shall I get the things when Dickon buys them?”</p>\n<p>“He’ll bring ’em to you himself. He’ll like to walk</p>\n<p>over this way.”</p>\n<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Mary, “then I shall see him! I never thought</p>\n<p>I should see Dickon.”</p>\n<p>“Does tha’ want to see him?” asked Martha suddenly, for Mary</p>\n<p>had looked so pleased.</p>\n<p>“Yes, I do. I never saw a boy foxes and crows loved. I want to see him</p>\n<p>very much.”</p>\n<p>Martha gave a little start, as if she remembered something.</p>\n<p>“Now to think,” she broke out, “to think o’ me</p>\n<p>forgettin’ that there; an’ I thought I was goin’ to tell you</p>\n<p>first thing this mornin’. I asked mother—and she said she’d</p>\n<p>ask Mrs. Medlock her own self.”</p>\n<p>“Do you mean—” Mary began.</p>\n<p>“What I said Tuesday. Ask her if you might be driven over to our cottage</p>\n<p>some day and have a bit o’ mother’s hot oat cake, an’ butter,</p>\n<p>an’ a glass o’ milk.”</p>\n<p>It seemed as if all the interesting things were happening in one day. To think</p>\n<p>of going over the moor in the daylight and when the sky was blue! To think of</p>\n<p>going into the cottage which held twelve children!</p>\n<p>“Does she think Mrs. Medlock would let me go?” she asked, quite</p>\n<p>anxiously.</p>\n<p>“Aye, she thinks she would. She knows what a tidy woman mother is and how</p>\n<p>clean she keeps the cottage.”</p>\n<p>“If I went I should see your mother as well as Dickon,” said Mary,</p>\n<p>thinking it over and liking the idea very much. “She doesn’t seem</p>\n<p>to be like the mothers in India.”</p>\n<p>Her work in the garden and the excitement of the afternoon ended by making her</p>\n<p>feel quiet and thoughtful. Martha stayed with her until tea-time, but they sat</p>\n<p>in comfortable quiet and talked very little. But just before Martha went</p>\n<p>downstairs for the tea-tray, Mary asked a question.</p>\n<p>“Martha,” she said, “has the scullery-maid had the toothache</p>\n<p>again today?”</p>\n<p>Martha certainly started slightly.</p>\n<p>“What makes thee ask that?” she said.</p>\n<p>“Because when I waited so long for you to come back I opened the door and</p>\n<p>walked down the corridor to see if you were coming. And I heard that far-off</p>\n<p>crying again, just as we heard it the other night. There isn’t a wind</p>\n<p>today, so you see it couldn’t have been the wind.”</p>\n<p>“Eh!” said Martha restlessly. “Tha’ mustn’t go</p>\n<p>walkin’ about in corridors an’ listenin’. Mr. Craven would be</p>\n<p>that there angry there’s no knowin’ what he’d do.”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t listening,” said Mary. “I was just waiting</p>\n<p>for you—and I heard it. That’s three times.”</p>\n<p>“My word! There’s Mrs. Medlock’s bell,” said Martha,</p>\n<p>and she almost ran out of the room.</p>\n<p>“It’s the strangest house anyone ever lived in,” said Mary</p>\n<p>drowsily, as she dropped her head on the cushioned seat of the armchair near</p>\n<p>her. Fresh air, and digging, and skipping-rope had made her feel so comfortably</p>\n<p>tired that she fell asleep.</p>\n"
