  "content": "<p>THE NEST OF THE MISSEL THRUSH</p>\n<p>For two or three minutes he stood looking round him, while Mary watched him,</p>\n<p>and then he began to walk about softly, even more lightly than Mary had walked</p>\n<p>the first time she had found herself inside the four walls. His eyes seemed to</p>\n<p>be taking in everything—the gray trees with the gray creepers climbing</p>\n<p>over them and hanging from their branches, the tangle on the walls and among</p>\n<p>the grass, the evergreen alcoves with the stone seats and tall flower urns</p>\n<p>standing in them.</p>\n<p>“I never thought I’d see this place,” he said at last, in a</p>\n<p>whisper.</p>\n<p>“Did you know about it?” asked Mary.</p>\n<p>She had spoken aloud and he made a sign to her.</p>\n<p>“We must talk low,” he said, “or someone’ll hear us</p>\n<p>an’ wonder what’s to do in here.”</p>\n<p>“Oh! I forgot!” said Mary, feeling frightened and putting her hand</p>\n<p>quickly against her mouth. “Did you know about the garden?” she</p>\n<p>asked again when she had recovered herself.</p>\n<p>Dickon nodded.</p>\n<p>“Martha told me there was one as no one ever went inside,” he</p>\n<p>answered. “Us used to wonder what it was like.”</p>\n<p>He stopped and looked round at the lovely gray tangle about him, and his round</p>\n<p>eyes looked queerly happy.</p>\n<p>“Eh! the nests as’ll be here come springtime,” he said.</p>\n<p>“It’d be th’ safest nestin’ place in England. No one</p>\n<p>never comin’ near an’ tangles o’ trees an’ roses to</p>\n<p>build in. I wonder all th’ birds on th’ moor don’t build</p>\n<p>here.”</p>\n<p>Mistress Mary put her hand on his arm again without knowing it.</p>\n<p>“Will there be roses?” she whispered. “Can you tell? I</p>\n<p>thought perhaps they were all dead.”</p>\n<p>“Eh! No! Not them—not all of ’em!” he answered.</p>\n<p>“Look here!”</p>\n<p>He stepped over to the nearest tree—an old, old one with gray lichen all</p>\n<p>over its bark, but upholding a curtain of tangled sprays and branches. He took</p>\n<p>a thick knife out of his pocket and opened one of its blades.</p>\n<p>“There’s lots o’ dead wood as ought to be cut out,” he</p>\n<p>said. “An’ there’s a lot o’ old wood, but it made some</p>\n<p>new last year. This here’s a new bit,” and he touched a shoot which</p>\n<p>looked brownish green instead of hard, dry gray.</p>\n<p>Mary touched it herself in an eager, reverent way.</p>\n<p>“That one?” she said. “Is that one quite alive quite?”</p>\n<p>Dickon curved his wide smiling mouth.</p>\n<p>“It’s as wick as you or me,” he said; and Mary remembered</p>\n<p>that Martha had told her that “wick” meant “alive” or</p>\n<p>“lively.”</p>\n<p>“I’m glad it’s wick!” she cried out in her whisper.</p>\n<p>“I want them all to be wick. Let us go round the garden and count how</p>\n<p>many wick ones there are.”</p>\n<p>She quite panted with eagerness, and Dickon was as eager as she was. They went</p>\n<p>from tree to tree and from bush to bush. Dickon carried his knife in his hand</p>\n<p>and showed her things which she thought wonderful.</p>\n<p>“They’ve run wild,” he said, “but th’ strongest</p>\n<p>ones has fair thrived on it. The delicatest ones has died out, but th’</p>\n<p>others has growed an’ growed, an’ spread an’ spread, till</p>\n<p>they’s a wonder. See here!” and he pulled down a thick gray,</p>\n<p>dry-looking branch. “A body might think this was dead wood, but I</p>\n<p>don’t believe it is—down to th’ root. I’ll cut it low</p>\n<p>down an’ see.”</p>\n<p>He knelt and with his knife cut the lifeless-looking branch through, not far</p>\n<p>above the earth.</p>\n<p>“There!” he said exultantly. “I told thee so. There’s</p>\n<p>green in that wood yet. Look at it.”</p>\n<p>Mary was down on her knees before he spoke, gazing with all her might.</p>\n<p>“When it looks a bit greenish an’ juicy like that, it’s</p>\n<p>wick,” he explained. “When th’ inside is dry an’ breaks</p>\n<p>easy, like this here piece I’ve cut off, it’s done for.</p>\n<p>There’s a big root here as all this live wood sprung out of, an’ if</p>\n<p>th’ old wood’s cut off an’ it’s dug round, and took</p>\n<p>care of there’ll be—” he stopped and lifted his face to look</p>\n<p>up at the climbing and hanging sprays above him—“there’ll be</p>\n<p>a fountain o’ roses here this summer.”</p>\n<p>They went from bush to bush and from tree to tree. He was very strong and</p>\n<p>clever with his knife and knew how to cut the dry and dead wood away, and could</p>\n<p>tell when an unpromising bough or twig had still green life in it. In the</p>\n<p>course of half an hour Mary thought she could tell too, and when he cut through</p>\n<p>a lifeless-looking branch she would cry out joyfully under her breath when she</p>\n<p>caught sight of the least shade of moist green. The spade, and hoe, and fork</p>\n<p>were very useful. He showed her how to use the fork while he dug about roots</p>\n<p>with the spade and stirred the earth and let the air in.</p>\n<p>They were working industriously round one of the biggest standard roses when he</p>\n<p>caught sight of something which made him utter an exclamation of surprise.</p>\n<p>“Why!” he cried, pointing to the grass a few feet away. “Who</p>\n<p>did that there?”</p>\n<p>It was one of Mary’s own little clearings round the pale green points.</p>\n<p>“I did it,” said Mary.</p>\n<p>“Why, I thought tha’ didn’t know nothin’ about</p>\n<p>gardenin’,” he exclaimed.</p>\n<p>“I don’t,” she answered, “but they were so little, and</p>\n<p>the grass was so thick and strong, and they looked as if they had no room to</p>\n<p>breathe. So I made a place for them. I don’t even know what they</p>\n<p>are.”</p>\n<p>Dickon went and knelt down by them, smiling his wide smile.</p>\n<p>“Tha’ was right,” he said. “A gardener couldn’t</p>\n<p>have told thee better. They’ll grow now like Jack’s bean-stalk.</p>\n<p>They’re crocuses an’ snowdrops, an’ these here is</p>\n<p>narcissuses,” turning to another patch, “an here’s</p>\n<p>daffydowndillys. Eh! they will be a sight.”</p>\n<p>He ran from one clearing to another.</p>\n<p>“Tha’ has done a lot o’ work for such a little wench,”</p>\n<p>he said, looking her over.</p>\n<p>“I’m growing fatter,” said Mary, “and I’m growing</p>\n<p>stronger. I used always to be tired. When I dig I’m not tired at all. I</p>\n<p>like to smell the earth when it’s turned up.”</p>\n<p>“It’s rare good for thee,” he said, nodding his head wisely.</p>\n<p>“There’s naught as nice as th’ smell o’ good clean</p>\n<p>earth, except th’ smell o’ fresh growin’ things when</p>\n<p>th’ rain falls on ’em. I get out on th’ moor many a day when</p>\n<p>it’s rainin’ an’ I lie under a bush an’ listen to</p>\n<p>th’ soft swish o’ drops on th’ heather an’ I just sniff</p>\n<p>an’ sniff. My nose end fair quivers like a rabbit’s, mother</p>\n<p>says.”</p>\n<p>“Do you never catch cold?” inquired Mary, gazing at him</p>\n<p>wonderingly. She had never seen such a funny boy, or such a nice one.</p>\n<p>“Not me,” he said, grinning. “I never ketched cold since I</p>\n<p>was born. I wasn’t brought up nesh enough. I’ve chased about</p>\n<p>th’ moor in all weathers same as th’ rabbits does. Mother says</p>\n<p>I’ve sniffed up too much fresh air for twelve year’ to ever get to</p>\n<p>sniffin’ with cold. I’m as tough as a white-thorn knobstick.”</p>\n<p>He was working all the time he was talking and Mary was following him and</p>\n<p>helping him with her fork or the trowel.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of work to do here!” he said once, looking</p>\n<p>about quite exultantly.</p>\n<p>“Will you come again and help me to do it?” Mary begged.</p>\n<p>“I’m sure I can help, too. I can dig and pull up weeds, and do</p>\n<p>whatever you tell me. Oh! do come, Dickon!”</p>\n<p>“I’ll come every day if tha’ wants me, rain or shine,”</p>\n<p>he answered stoutly. “It’s the best fun I ever had in my</p>\n<p>life—shut in here an’ wakenin’ up a garden.”</p>\n<p>“If you will come,” said Mary, “if you will help me to make</p>\n<p>it alive I’ll—I don’t know what I’ll do,” she</p>\n<p>ended helplessly. What could you do for a boy like that?</p>\n<p>“I’ll tell thee what tha’ll do,” said Dickon, with his</p>\n<p>happy grin. “Tha’ll get fat an’ tha’ll get as hungry as</p>\n<p>a young fox an’ tha’ll learn how to talk to th’ robin same as</p>\n<p>I do. Eh! we’ll have a lot o’ fun.”</p>\n<p>He began to walk about, looking up in the trees and at the walls and bushes</p>\n<p>with a thoughtful expression.</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t want to make it look like a gardener’s garden,</p>\n<p>all clipped an’ spick an’ span, would you?” he said.</p>\n<p>“It’s nicer like this with things runnin’ wild, an’</p>\n<p>swingin’ an’ catchin’ hold of each other.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t let us make it tidy,” said Mary anxiously. “It</p>\n<p>wouldn’t seem like a secret garden if it was tidy.”</p>\n<p>Dickon stood rubbing his rusty-red head with a rather puzzled look.</p>\n<p>“It’s a secret garden sure enough,” he said, “but seems</p>\n<p>like someone besides th’ robin must have been in it since it was shut up</p>\n<p>ten year’ ago.”</p>\n<p>“But the door was locked and the key was buried,” said Mary.</p>\n<p>“No one could get in.”</p>\n<p>“That’s true,” he answered. “It’s a queer place.</p>\n<p>Seems to me as if there’d been a bit o’ prunin’ done here</p>\n<p>an’ there, later than ten year’ ago.”</p>\n<p>“But how could it have been done?” said Mary.</p>\n<p>He was examining a branch of a standard rose and he shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Aye! how could it!” he murmured. “With th’ door locked</p>\n<p>an’ th’ key buried.”</p>\n<p>Mistress Mary always felt that however many years she lived she should never</p>\n<p>forget that first morning when her garden began to grow. Of course, it did seem</p>\n<p>to begin to grow for her that morning. When Dickon began to clear places to</p>\n<p>plant seeds, she remembered what Basil had sung at her when he wanted to tease</p>\n<p>her.</p>\n<p>“Are there any flowers that look like bells?” she inquired.</p>\n<p>“Lilies o’ th’ valley does,” he answered, digging away</p>\n<p>with the trowel, “an’ there’s Canterbury bells, an’</p>\n<p>campanulas.”</p>\n<p>“Let’s plant some,” said Mary.</p>\n<p>“There’s lilies o’ th, valley here already; I saw ’em.</p>\n<p>They’ll have growed too close an’ we’ll have to separate</p>\n<p>’em, but there’s plenty. Th’ other ones takes two years to</p>\n<p>bloom from seed, but I can bring you some bits o’ plants from our cottage</p>\n<p>garden. Why does tha’ want ’em?”</p>\n<p>Then Mary told him about Basil and his brothers and sisters in India and of how</p>\n<p>she had hated them and of their calling her “Mistress Mary Quite</p>\n<p>Contrary.”</p>\n<p>“They used to dance round and sing at me. They sang—</p>\n<p>‘Mistress Mary, quite contrary,</p>\n<p>How does your garden grow?</p>\n<p>With silver bells, and cockle shells,</p>\n<p>And marigolds all in a row.’</p>\n<p>I just remembered it and it made me wonder if there were really flowers like</p>\n<p>silver bells.”</p>\n<p>She frowned a little and gave her trowel a rather spiteful dig into the earth.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t as contrary as they were.”</p>\n<p>But Dickon laughed.</p>\n<p>“Eh!” he said, and as he crumbled the rich black soil she saw he</p>\n<p>was sniffing up the scent of it. “There doesn’t seem to be no need</p>\n<p>for no one to be contrary when there’s flowers an’ such like,</p>\n<p>an’ such lots o’ friendly wild things runnin’ about</p>\n<p>makin’ homes for themselves, or buildin’ nests an’</p>\n<p>singin’ an’ whistlin’, does there?”</p>\n<p>Mary, kneeling by him holding the seeds, looked at him and stopped frowning.</p>\n<p>“Dickon,” she said, “you are as nice as Martha said you were.</p>\n<p>I like you, and you make the fifth person. I never thought I should like five</p>\n<p>people.”</p>\n<p>Dickon sat up on his heels as Martha did when she was polishing the grate. He</p>\n<p>did look funny and delightful, Mary thought, with his round blue eyes and red</p>\n<p>cheeks and happy looking turned-up nose.</p>\n<p>“Only five folk as tha’ likes?” he said. “Who is</p>\n<p>th’ other four?”</p>\n<p>“Your mother and Martha,” Mary checked them off on her fingers,</p>\n<p>“and the robin and Ben Weatherstaff.”</p>\n<p>Dickon laughed so that he was obliged to stifle the sound by putting his arm</p>\n<p>over his mouth.</p>\n<p>“I know tha’ thinks I’m a queer lad,” he said,</p>\n<p>“but I think tha’ art th’ queerest little lass I ever</p>\n<p>saw.”</p>\n<p>Then Mary did a strange thing. She leaned forward and asked him a question she</p>\n<p>had never dreamed of asking anyone before. And she tried to ask it in</p>\n<p>Yorkshire because that was his language, and in India a native was always</p>\n<p>pleased if you knew his speech.</p>\n<p>“Does tha’ like me?” she said.</p>\n<p>“Eh!” he answered heartily, “that I does. I likes thee</p>\n<p>wonderful, an’ so does th’ robin, I do believe!”</p>\n<p>“That’s two, then,” said Mary. “That’s two for</p>\n<p>me.”</p>\n<p>And then they began to work harder than ever and more joyfully. Mary was</p>\n<p>startled and sorry when she heard the big clock in the courtyard strike the</p>\n<p>hour of her midday dinner.</p>\n<p>“I shall have to go,” she said mournfully. “And you will have</p>\n<p>to go too, won’t you?”</p>\n<p>Dickon grinned.</p>\n<p>“My dinner’s easy to carry about with me,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Mother always lets me put a bit o’ somethin’ in my</p>\n<p>pocket.”</p>\n<p>He picked up his coat from the grass and brought out of a pocket a lumpy little</p>\n<p>bundle tied up in a quite clean, coarse, blue and white handkerchief. It held</p>\n<p>two thick pieces of bread with a slice of something laid between them.</p>\n<p>“It’s oftenest naught but bread,” he said, “but</p>\n<p>I’ve got a fine slice o’ fat bacon with it today.”</p>\n<p>Mary thought it looked a queer dinner, but he seemed ready to enjoy it.</p>\n<p>“Run on an’ get thy victuals,” he said. “I’ll be</p>\n<p>done with mine first. I’ll get some more work done before I start back</p>\n<p>home.”</p>\n<p>He sat down with his back against a tree.</p>\n<p>“I’ll call th’ robin up,” he said, “and give him</p>\n<p>th’ rind o’ th’ bacon to peck at. They likes a bit o’</p>\n<p>fat wonderful.”</p>\n<p>Mary could scarcely bear to leave him. Suddenly it seemed as if he might be a</p>\n<p>sort of wood fairy who might be gone when she came into the garden again. He</p>\n<p>seemed too good to be true. She went slowly half-way to the door in the wall</p>\n<p>and then she stopped and went back.</p>\n<p>“Whatever happens, you—you never would tell?” she said.</p>\n<p>His poppy-colored cheeks were distended with his first big bite of bread and</p>\n<p>bacon, but he managed to smile encouragingly.</p>\n<p>“If tha’ was a missel thrush an’ showed me where thy nest</p>\n<p>was, does tha’ think I’d tell anyone? Not me,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Tha’ art as safe as a missel thrush.”</p>\n<p>And she was quite sure she was.</p>\n"
