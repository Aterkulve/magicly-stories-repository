  "content": "<p>ACROSS THE MOOR</p>\n<p>She slept a long time, and when she awakened Mrs. Medlock had bought a</p>\n<p>lunchbasket at one of the stations and they had some chicken and cold beef and</p>\n<p>bread and butter and some hot tea. The rain seemed to be streaming down more</p>\n<p>heavily than ever and everybody in the station wore wet and glistening</p>\n<p>waterproofs. The guard lighted the lamps in the carriage, and Mrs. Medlock</p>\n<p>cheered up very much over her tea and chicken and beef. She ate a great deal</p>\n<p>and afterward fell asleep herself, and Mary sat and stared at her and watched</p>\n<p>her fine bonnet slip on one side until she herself fell asleep once more in the</p>\n<p>corner of the carriage, lulled by the splashing of the rain against the</p>\n<p>windows. It was quite dark when she awakened again. The train had stopped at a</p>\n<p>station and Mrs. Medlock was shaking her.</p>\n<p>“You have had a sleep!” she said. “It’s time to open</p>\n<p>your eyes! We’re at Thwaite Station and we’ve got a long drive</p>\n<p>before us.”</p>\n<p>Mary stood up and tried to keep her eyes open while Mrs. Medlock collected her</p>\n<p>parcels. The little girl did not offer to help her, because in India native</p>\n<p>servants always picked up or carried things and it seemed quite proper that</p>\n<p>other people should wait on one.</p>\n<p>The station was a small one and nobody but themselves seemed to be getting out</p>\n<p>of the train. The station-master spoke to Mrs. Medlock in a rough, good-natured</p>\n<p>way, pronouncing his words in a queer broad fashion which Mary found out</p>\n<p>afterward was Yorkshire.</p>\n<p>“I see tha’s got back,” he said. “An’ tha’s</p>\n<p>browt th’ young ’un with thee.”</p>\n<p>“Aye, that’s her,” answered Mrs. Medlock, speaking with a</p>\n<p>Yorkshire accent herself and jerking her head over her shoulder toward Mary.</p>\n<p>“How’s thy Missus?”</p>\n<p>“Well enow. Th’ carriage is waitin’ outside for thee.”</p>\n<p>A brougham stood on the road before the little outside platform. Mary saw that</p>\n<p>it was a smart carriage and that it was a smart footman who helped her in. His</p>\n<p>long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering of his hat were shining and</p>\n<p>dripping with rain as everything was, the burly station-master included.</p>\n<p>When he shut the door, mounted the box with the coachman, and they drove off,</p>\n<p>the little girl found herself seated in a comfortably cushioned corner, but she</p>\n<p>was not inclined to go to sleep again. She sat and looked out of the window,</p>\n<p>curious to see something of the road over which she was being driven to the</p>\n<p>queer place Mrs. Medlock had spoken of. She was not at all a timid child and</p>\n<p>she was not exactly frightened, but she felt that there was no knowing what</p>\n<p>might happen in a house with a hundred rooms nearly all shut up—a house</p>\n<p>standing on the edge of a moor.</p>\n<p>“What is a moor?” she said suddenly to Mrs. Medlock.</p>\n<p>“Look out of the window in about ten minutes and you’ll see,”</p>\n<p>the woman answered. “We’ve got to drive five miles across Missel</p>\n<p>Moor before we get to the Manor. You won’t see much because it’s a</p>\n<p>dark night, but you can see something.”</p>\n<p>Mary asked no more questions but waited in the darkness of her corner, keeping</p>\n<p>her eyes on the window. The carriage lamps cast rays of light a little distance</p>\n<p>ahead of them and she caught glimpses of the things they passed. After they had</p>\n<p>left the station they had driven through a tiny village and she had seen</p>\n<p>whitewashed cottages and the lights of a public house. Then they had passed a</p>\n<p>church and a vicarage and a little shop-window or so in a cottage with toys and</p>\n<p>sweets and odd things set out for sale. Then they were on the highroad and she</p>\n<p>saw hedges and trees. After that there seemed nothing different for a long</p>\n<p>time—or at least it seemed a long time to her.</p>\n<p>At last the horses began to go more slowly, as if they were climbing up-hill,</p>\n<p>and presently there seemed to be no more hedges and no more trees. She could</p>\n<p>see nothing, in fact, but a dense darkness on either side. She leaned forward</p>\n<p>and pressed her face against the window just as the carriage gave a big jolt.</p>\n<p>“Eh! We’re on the moor now sure enough,” said Mrs. Medlock.</p>\n<p>The carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough-looking road which seemed to</p>\n<p>be cut through bushes and low-growing things which ended in the great expanse</p>\n<p>of dark apparently spread out before and around them. A wind was rising and</p>\n<p>making a singular, wild, low, rushing sound.</p>\n<p>“It’s—it’s not the sea, is it?” said Mary,</p>\n<p>looking round at her companion.</p>\n<p>“No, not it,” answered Mrs. Medlock. “Nor it isn’t</p>\n<p>fields nor mountains, it’s just miles and miles and miles of wild land</p>\n<p>that nothing grows on but heather and gorse and broom, and nothing lives on but</p>\n<p>wild ponies and sheep.”</p>\n<p>“I feel as if it might be the sea, if there were water on it,” said</p>\n<p>Mary. “It sounds like the sea just now.”</p>\n<p>“That’s the wind blowing through the bushes,” Mrs. Medlock</p>\n<p>said. “It’s a wild, dreary enough place to my mind, though</p>\n<p>there’s plenty that likes it—particularly when the heather’s</p>\n<p>in bloom.”</p>\n<p>On and on they drove through the darkness, and though the rain stopped, the</p>\n<p>wind rushed by and whistled and made strange sounds. The road went up and down,</p>\n<p>and several times the carriage passed over a little bridge beneath which water</p>\n<p>rushed very fast with a great deal of noise. Mary felt as if the drive would</p>\n<p>never come to an end and that the wide, bleak moor was a wide expanse of black</p>\n<p>ocean through which she was passing on a strip of dry land.</p>\n<p>“I don’t like it,” she said to herself. “I don’t</p>\n<p>like it,” and she pinched her thin lips more tightly together.</p>\n<p>The horses were climbing up a hilly piece of road when she first caught sight</p>\n<p>of a light. Mrs. Medlock saw it as soon as she did and drew a long sigh of</p>\n<p>relief.</p>\n<p>“Eh, I am glad to see that bit o’ light twinkling,” she</p>\n<p>exclaimed. “It’s the light in the lodge window. We shall get a good</p>\n<p>cup of tea after a bit, at all events.”</p>\n<p>It was “after a bit,” as she said, for when the carriage passed</p>\n<p>through the park gates there was still two miles of avenue to drive through and</p>\n<p>the trees (which nearly met overhead) made it seem as if they were driving</p>\n<p>through a long dark vault.</p>\n<p>They drove out of the vault into a clear space and stopped before an immensely</p>\n<p>long but low-built house which seemed to ramble round a stone court. At first</p>\n<p>Mary thought that there were no lights at all in the windows, but as she got</p>\n<p>out of the carriage she saw that one room in a corner upstairs showed a dull</p>\n<p>glow.</p>\n<p>The entrance door was a huge one made of massive, curiously shaped panels of</p>\n<p>oak studded with big iron nails and bound with great iron bars. It opened into</p>\n<p>an enormous hall, which was so dimly lighted that the faces in the portraits on</p>\n<p>the walls and the figures in the suits of armor made Mary feel that she did not</p>\n<p>want to look at them. As she stood on the stone floor she looked a very small,</p>\n<p>odd little black figure, and she felt as small and lost and odd as she looked.</p>\n<p>A neat, thin old man stood near the manservant who opened the door for them.</p>\n<p>“You are to take her to her room,” he said in a husky voice.</p>\n<p>“He doesn’t want to see her. He’s going to London in the</p>\n<p>morning.”</p>\n<p>“Very well, Mr. Pitcher,” Mrs. Medlock answered. “So long as</p>\n<p>I know what’s expected of me, I can manage.”</p>\n<p>“What’s expected of you, Mrs. Medlock,” Mr. Pitcher said,</p>\n<p>“is that you make sure that he’s not disturbed and that he</p>\n<p>doesn’t see what he doesn’t want to see.”</p>\n<p>And then Mary Lennox was led up a broad staircase and down a long corridor and</p>\n<p>up a short flight of steps and through another corridor and another, until a</p>\n<p>door opened in a wall and she found herself in a room with a fire in it and a</p>\n<p>supper on a table.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Medlock said unceremoniously:</p>\n<p>“Well, here you are! This room and the next are where you’ll</p>\n<p>live—and you must keep to them. Don’t you forget that!”</p>\n<p>It was in this way Mistress Mary arrived at Misselthwaite Manor and she had</p>\n<p>perhaps never felt quite so contrary in all her life.</p>\n"
