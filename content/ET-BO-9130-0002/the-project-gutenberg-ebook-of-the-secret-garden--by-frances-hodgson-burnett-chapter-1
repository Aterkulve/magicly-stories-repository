  "content": "<p>THERE IS NO ONE LEFT</p>\n<p>When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle</p>\n<p>everybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen. It was</p>\n<p>true, too. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair</p>\n<p>and a sour expression. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she</p>\n<p>had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another. Her</p>\n<p>father had held a position under the English Government and had always been</p>\n<p>busy and ill himself, and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to</p>\n<p>go to parties and amuse herself with gay people. She had not wanted a little</p>\n<p>girl at all, and when Mary was born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah,</p>\n<p>who was made to understand that if she wished to please the Mem Sahib she must</p>\n<p>keep the child out of sight as much as possible. So when she was a sickly,</p>\n<p>fretful, ugly little baby she was kept out of the way, and when she became a</p>\n<p>sickly, fretful, toddling thing she was kept out of the way also. She never</p>\n<p>remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her Ayah and the</p>\n<p>other native servants, and as they always obeyed her and gave her her own way</p>\n<p>in everything, because the Mem Sahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her</p>\n<p>crying, by the time she was six years old she was as tyrannical and selfish a</p>\n<p>little pig as ever lived. The young English governess who came to teach her to</p>\n<p>read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months,</p>\n<p>and when other governesses came to try to fill it they always went away in a</p>\n<p>shorter time than the first one. So if Mary had not chosen to really want to</p>\n<p>know how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all.</p>\n<p>One frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine years old, she awakened</p>\n<p>feeling very cross, and she became crosser still when she saw that the servant</p>\n<p>who stood by her bedside was not her Ayah.</p>\n<p>“Why did you come?” she said to the strange woman. “I will</p>\n<p>not let you stay. Send my Ayah to me.”</p>\n<p>The woman looked frightened, but she only stammered that the Ayah could not</p>\n<p>come and when Mary threw herself into a passion and beat and kicked her, she</p>\n<p>looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not possible for the Ayah</p>\n<p>to come to Missie Sahib.</p>\n<p>There was something mysterious in the air that morning. Nothing was done in its</p>\n<p>regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing, while those</p>\n<p>whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces. But no one</p>\n<p>would tell her anything and her Ayah did not come. She was actually left alone</p>\n<p>as the morning went on, and at last she wandered out into the garden and began</p>\n<p>to play by herself under a tree near the veranda. She pretended that she was</p>\n<p>making a flower-bed, and she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little</p>\n<p>heaps of earth, all the time growing more and more angry and muttering to</p>\n<p>herself the things she would say and the names she would call Saidie when she</p>\n<p>returned.</p>\n<p>“Pig! Pig! Daughter of Pigs!” she said, because to call a native a</p>\n<p>pig is the worst insult of all.</p>\n<p>She was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when she heard</p>\n<p>her mother come out on the veranda with someone. She was with a fair young man</p>\n<p>and they stood talking together in low strange voices. Mary knew the fair young</p>\n<p>man who looked like a boy. She had heard that he was a very young officer who</p>\n<p>had just come from England. The child stared at him, but she stared most at her</p>\n<p>mother. She always did this when she had a chance to see her, because the Mem</p>\n<p>Sahib—Mary used to call her that oftener than anything else—was</p>\n<p>such a tall, slim, pretty person and wore such lovely clothes. Her hair was</p>\n<p>like curly silk and she had a delicate little nose which seemed to be</p>\n<p>disdaining things, and she had large laughing eyes. All her clothes were thin</p>\n<p>and floating, and Mary said they were “full of lace.” They looked</p>\n<p>fuller of lace than ever this morning, but her eyes were not laughing at all.</p>\n<p>They were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy</p>\n<p>officer’s face.</p>\n<p>“Is it so very bad? Oh, is it?” Mary heard her say.</p>\n<p>“Awfully,” the young man answered in a trembling voice.</p>\n<p>“Awfully, Mrs. Lennox. You ought to have gone to the hills two weeks</p>\n<p>ago.”</p>\n<p>The Mem Sahib wrung her hands.</p>\n<p>“Oh, I know I ought!” she cried. “I only stayed to go to that</p>\n<p>silly dinner party. What a fool I was!”</p>\n<p>At that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out from the</p>\n<p>servants’ quarters that she clutched the young man’s arm, and Mary</p>\n<p>stood shivering from head to foot. The wailing grew wilder and wilder.</p>\n<p>“What is it? What is it?” Mrs. Lennox gasped.</p>\n<p>“Someone has died,” answered the boy officer. “You did not</p>\n<p>say it had broken out among your servants.”</p>\n<p>“I did not know!” the Mem Sahib cried. “Come with me! Come</p>\n<p>with me!” and she turned and ran into the house.</p>\n<p>After that appalling things happened, and the mysteriousness of the morning</p>\n<p>was explained to Mary. The cholera had broken out in its most fatal form and</p>\n<p>people were dying like flies. The Ayah had been taken ill in the night, and it</p>\n<p>was because she had just died that the servants had wailed in the huts. Before</p>\n<p>the next day three other servants were dead and others had run away in terror.</p>\n<p>There was panic on every side, and dying people in all the bungalows.</p>\n<p>During the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary hid herself in the</p>\n<p>nursery and was forgotten by everyone. Nobody thought of her, nobody wanted</p>\n<p>her, and strange things happened of which she knew nothing. Mary alternately</p>\n<p>cried and slept through the hours. She only knew that people were ill and that</p>\n<p>she heard mysterious and frightening sounds. Once she crept into the</p>\n<p>dining-room and found it empty, though a partly finished meal was on the table</p>\n<p>and chairs and plates looked as if they had been hastily pushed back when the</p>\n<p>diners rose suddenly for some reason. The child ate some fruit and biscuits,</p>\n<p>and being thirsty she drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled. It was</p>\n<p>sweet, and she did not know how strong it was. Very soon it made her intensely</p>\n<p>drowsy, and she went back to her nursery and shut herself in again, frightened</p>\n<p>by cries she heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of feet. The wine made</p>\n<p>her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyes open and she lay down on</p>\n<p>her bed and knew nothing more for a long time.</p>\n<p>Many things happened during the hours in which she slept so heavily, but she</p>\n<p>was not disturbed by the wails and the sound of things being carried in and out</p>\n<p>of the bungalow.</p>\n<p>When she awakened she lay and stared at the wall. The house was perfectly</p>\n<p>still. She had never known it to be so silent before. She heard neither voices</p>\n<p>nor footsteps, and wondered if everybody had got well of the cholera and all</p>\n<p>the trouble was over. She wondered also who would take care of her now her Ayah</p>\n<p>was dead. There would be a new Ayah, and perhaps she would know some new</p>\n<p>stories. Mary had been rather tired of the old ones. She did not cry because</p>\n<p>her nurse had died. She was not an affectionate child and had never cared much</p>\n<p>for anyone. The noise and hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had</p>\n<p>frightened her, and she had been angry because no one seemed to remember that</p>\n<p>she was alive. Everyone was too panic-stricken to think of a little girl no one</p>\n<p>was fond of. When people had the cholera it seemed that they remembered nothing</p>\n<p>but themselves. But if everyone had got well again, surely someone would</p>\n<p>remember and come to look for her.</p>\n<p>But no one came, and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow more and more</p>\n<p>silent. She heard something rustling on the matting and when she looked down</p>\n<p>she saw a little snake gliding along and watching her with eyes like jewels.</p>\n<p>She was not frightened, because he was a harmless little thing who would not</p>\n<p>hurt her and he seemed in a hurry to get out of the room. He slipped under the</p>\n<p>door as she watched him.</p>\n<p>“How queer and quiet it is,” she said. “It sounds as if there</p>\n<p>were no one in the bungalow but me and the snake.”</p>\n<p>Almost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound, and then on the</p>\n<p>veranda. They were men’s footsteps, and the men entered the bungalow and</p>\n<p>talked in low voices. No one went to meet or speak to them and they seemed to</p>\n<p>open doors and look into rooms.</p>\n<p>“What desolation!” she heard one voice say. “That pretty,</p>\n<p>pretty woman! I suppose the child, too. I heard there was a child, though no</p>\n<p>one ever saw her.”</p>\n<p>Mary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the door a few</p>\n<p>minutes later. She looked an ugly, cross little thing and was frowning because</p>\n<p>she was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected. The first man</p>\n<p>who came in was a large officer she had once seen talking to her father. He</p>\n<p>looked tired and troubled, but when he saw her he was so startled that he</p>\n<p>almost jumped back.</p>\n<p>“Barney!” he cried out. “There is a child here! A child</p>\n<p>alone! In a place like this! Mercy on us, who is she!”</p>\n<p>“I am Mary Lennox,” the little girl said, drawing herself up</p>\n<p>stiffly. She thought the man was very rude to call her father’s bungalow</p>\n<p>“A place like this!” “I fell asleep when everyone had the</p>\n<p>cholera and I have only just wakened up. Why does nobody come?”</p>\n<p>“It is the child no one ever saw!” exclaimed the man, turning to</p>\n<p>his companions. “She has actually been forgotten!”</p>\n<p>“Why was I forgotten?” Mary said, stamping her foot. “Why</p>\n<p>does nobody come?”</p>\n<p>The young man whose name was Barney looked at her very sadly. Mary even thought</p>\n<p>she saw him wink his eyes as if to wink tears away.</p>\n<p>“Poor little kid!” he said. “There is nobody left to</p>\n<p>come.”</p>\n<p>It was in that strange and sudden way that Mary found out that she had neither</p>\n<p>father nor mother left; that they had died and been carried away in the night,</p>\n<p>and that the few native servants who had not died also had left the house as</p>\n<p>quickly as they could get out of it, none of them even remembering that there</p>\n<p>was a Missie Sahib. That was why the place was so quiet. It was true that there</p>\n<p>was no one in the bungalow but herself and the little rustling snake.</p>\n"
