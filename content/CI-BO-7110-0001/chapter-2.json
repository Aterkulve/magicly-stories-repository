  "content": "<p>The Garden of Live Flowers</p>\n<p>“I should see the garden far better,” said Alice to herself,</p>\n<p>“if I could get to the top of that hill: and here’s a path that</p>\n<p>leads straight to it—at least, no, it doesn’t do that—”</p>\n<p>(after going a few yards along the path, and turning several sharp corners),</p>\n<p>“but I suppose it will at last. But how curiously it twists! It’s</p>\n<p>more like a corkscrew than a path! Well,</p>\n<p>this</p>\n<p>turn goes to the hill, I</p>\n<p>suppose—no, it doesn’t! This goes straight back to the house! Well</p>\n<p>then, I’ll try it the other way.”</p>\n<p>And so she did: wandering up and down, and trying turn after turn, but always</p>\n<p>coming back to the house, do what she would. Indeed, once, when she turned a</p>\n<p>corner rather more quickly than usual, she ran against it before she could stop</p>\n<p>herself.</p>\n<p>“It’s no use talking about it,” Alice said, looking up at the</p>\n<p>house and pretending it was arguing with her. “I’m</p>\n<p>not</p>\n<p>going</p>\n<p>in again yet. I know I should have to get through the Looking-glass</p>\n<p>again—back into the old room—and there’d be an end of all my</p>\n<p>adventures!”</p>\n<p>So, resolutely turning her back upon the house, she set out once more down the</p>\n<p>path, determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill. For a few</p>\n<p>minutes all went on well, and she was just saying, “I really</p>\n<p>shall</p>\n<p>do it this time—” when the path gave a sudden twist and shook</p>\n<p>itself (as she described it afterwards), and the next moment she found herself</p>\n<p>actually walking in at the door.</p>\n<p>“Oh, it’s too bad!” she cried. “I never saw such a</p>\n<p>house for getting in the way! Never!”</p>\n<p>However, there was the hill full in sight, so there was nothing to be done but</p>\n<p>start again. This time she came upon a large flower-bed, with a border of</p>\n<p>daisies, and a willow-tree growing in the middle.</p>\n<p>“O Tiger-lily,” said Alice, addressing herself to one that was</p>\n<p>waving gracefully about in the wind, “I</p>\n<p>wish</p>\n<p>you could</p>\n<p>talk!”</p>\n<p>“We</p>\n<p>can</p>\n<p>talk,” said the Tiger-lily: “when</p>\n<p>there’s anybody worth talking to.”</p>\n<p>Alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute: it quite seemed</p>\n<p>to take her breath away. At length, as the Tiger-lily only went on waving</p>\n<p>about, she spoke again, in a timid voice—almost in a whisper. “And</p>\n<p>can</p>\n<p>all</p>\n<p>the flowers talk?”</p>\n<p>“As well as</p>\n<p>you</p>\n<p>can,” said the Tiger-lily. “And a</p>\n<p>great deal louder.”</p>\n<p>“It isn’t manners for us to begin, you know,” said the Rose,</p>\n<p>“and I really was wondering when you’d speak! Said I to myself,</p>\n<p>‘Her face has got</p>\n<p>some</p>\n<p>sense in it, though it’s not a clever</p>\n<p>one!’ Still, you’re the right colour, and that goes a long</p>\n<p>way.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t care about the colour,” the Tiger-lily remarked.</p>\n<p>“If only her petals curled up a little more, she’d be all</p>\n<p>right.”</p>\n<p>Alice didn’t like being criticised, so she began asking questions.</p>\n<p>“Aren’t you sometimes frightened at being planted out here, with</p>\n<p>nobody to take care of you?”</p>\n<p>“There’s the tree in the middle,” said the Rose: “what</p>\n<p>else is it good for?”</p>\n<p>“But what could it do, if any danger came?” Alice asked.</p>\n<p>“It says ‘Bough-wough!’” cried a Daisy:</p>\n<p>“that’s why its branches are called boughs!”</p>\n<p>“Didn’t you know</p>\n<p>that</p>\n<p>?” cried another Daisy, and here</p>\n<p>they all began shouting together, till the air seemed quite full of little</p>\n<p>shrill voices. “Silence, every one of you!” cried the Tiger-lily,</p>\n<p>waving itself passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement.</p>\n<p>“They know I can’t get at them!” it panted, bending its</p>\n<p>quivering head towards Alice, “or they wouldn’t dare to do</p>\n<p>it!”</p>\n<p>“Never mind!” Alice said in a soothing tone, and stooping down to</p>\n<p>the daisies, who were just beginning again, she whispered, “If you</p>\n<p>don’t hold your tongues, I’ll pick you!”</p>\n<p>There was silence in a moment, and several of the pink daisies turned white.</p>\n<p>“That’s right!” said the Tiger-lily. “The daisies are</p>\n<p>worst of all. When one speaks, they all begin together, and it’s enough</p>\n<p>to make one wither to hear the way they go on!”</p>\n<p>“How is it you can all talk so nicely?” Alice said, hoping to get</p>\n<p>it into a better temper by a compliment. “I’ve been in many gardens</p>\n<p>before, but none of the flowers could talk.”</p>\n<p>“Put your hand down, and feel the ground,” said the Tiger-lily.</p>\n<p>“Then you’ll know why.”</p>\n<p>Alice did so. “It’s very hard,” she said, “but I</p>\n<p>don’t see what that has to do with it.”</p>\n<p>“In most gardens,” the Tiger-lily said, “they make the beds</p>\n<p>too soft—so that the flowers are always asleep.”</p>\n<p>This sounded a very good reason, and Alice was quite pleased to know it.</p>\n<p>“I never thought of that before!” she said.</p>\n<p>“It’s</p>\n<p>my</p>\n<p>opinion that you never think</p>\n<p>at all</p>\n<p>,”</p>\n<p>the Rose said in a rather severe tone.</p>\n<p>“I never saw anybody that looked stupider,” a Violet said, so</p>\n<p>suddenly, that Alice quite jumped; for it hadn’t spoken before.</p>\n<p>“Hold</p>\n<p>your</p>\n<p>tongue!” cried the Tiger-lily. “As if</p>\n<p>you</p>\n<p>ever saw anybody! You keep your head under the leaves, and snore</p>\n<p>away there, till you know no more what’s going on in the world, than if</p>\n<p>you were a bud!”</p>\n<p>“Are there any more people in the garden besides me?” Alice said,</p>\n<p>not choosing to notice the Rose’s last remark.</p>\n<p>“There’s one other flower in the garden that can move about like</p>\n<p>you,” said the Rose. “I wonder how you do it—”</p>\n<p>(“You’re always wondering,” said the Tiger-lily), “but</p>\n<p>she’s more bushy than you are.”</p>\n<p>“Is she like me?” Alice asked eagerly, for the thought crossed her</p>\n<p>mind, “There’s another little girl in the garden, somewhere!”</p>\n<p>“Well, she has the same awkward shape as you,” the Rose said,</p>\n<p>“but she’s redder—and her petals are shorter, I think.”</p>\n<p>“Her petals are done up close, almost like a dahlia,” the</p>\n<p>Tiger-lily interrupted: “not tumbled about anyhow, like yours.”</p>\n<p>“But that’s not</p>\n<p>your</p>\n<p>fault,” the Rose added kindly:</p>\n<p>“you’re beginning to fade, you know—and then one can’t</p>\n<p>help one’s petals getting a little untidy.”</p>\n<p>Alice didn’t like this idea at all: so, to change the subject, she asked</p>\n<p>“Does she ever come out here?”</p>\n<p>“I daresay you’ll see her soon,” said the Rose.</p>\n<p>“She’s one of the thorny kind.”</p>\n<p>“Where does she wear the thorns?” Alice asked with some curiosity.</p>\n<p>“Why all round her head, of course,” the Rose replied. “I was</p>\n<p>wondering</p>\n<p>you</p>\n<p>hadn’t got some too. I thought it was the regular</p>\n<p>rule.”</p>\n<p>“She’s coming!” cried the Larkspur. “I hear her</p>\n<p>footstep, thump, thump, thump, along the gravel-walk!”</p>\n<p>Alice looked round eagerly, and found that it was the Red Queen.</p>\n<p>“She’s grown a good deal!” was her first remark. She had</p>\n<p>indeed: when Alice first found her in the ashes, she had been only three inches</p>\n<p>high—and here she was, half a head taller than Alice herself!</p>\n<p>“It’s the fresh air that does it,” said the Rose:</p>\n<p>“wonderfully fine air it is, out here.”</p>\n<p>“I think I’ll go and meet her,” said Alice, for, though the</p>\n<p>flowers were interesting enough, she felt that it would be far grander to have</p>\n<p>a talk with a real Queen.</p>\n<p>“You can’t possibly do that,” said the Rose: “</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>should advise you to walk the other way.”</p>\n<p>This sounded nonsense to Alice, so she said nothing, but set off at once</p>\n<p>towards the Red Queen. To her surprise, she lost sight of her in a moment, and</p>\n<p>found herself walking in at the front-door again.</p>\n<p>A little provoked, she drew back, and after looking everywhere for the queen</p>\n<p>(whom she spied out at last, a long way off), she thought she would try the</p>\n<p>plan, this time, of walking in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>It succeeded beautifully. She had not been walking a minute before she found</p>\n<p>herself face to face with the Red Queen, and full in sight of the hill she had</p>\n<p>been so long aiming at.</p>\n<p>“Where do you come from?” said the Red Queen. “And where are</p>\n<p>you going? Look up, speak nicely, and don’t twiddle your fingers all the</p>\n<p>time.”</p>\n<p>Alice attended to all these directions, and explained, as well as she could,</p>\n<p>that she had lost her way.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know what you mean by</p>\n<p>your</p>\n<p>way,” said the</p>\n<p>Queen: “all the ways about here belong to</p>\n<p>me</p>\n<p>—but why did you</p>\n<p>come out here at all?” she added in a kinder tone. “Curtsey while</p>\n<p>you’re thinking what to say, it saves time.”</p>\n<p>Alice wondered a little at this, but she was too much in awe of the Queen to</p>\n<p>disbelieve it. “I’ll try it when I go home,” she thought to</p>\n<p>herself, “the next time I’m a little late for dinner.”</p>\n<p>“It’s time for you to answer now,” the Queen said, looking at</p>\n<p>her watch: “open your mouth a</p>\n<p>little</p>\n<p>wider when you speak, and</p>\n<p>always say ‘your Majesty.’”</p>\n<p>“I only wanted to see what the garden was like, your</p>\n<p>Majesty—”</p>\n<p>“That’s right,” said the Queen, patting her on the head,</p>\n<p>which Alice didn’t like at all, “though, when you say</p>\n<p>‘garden,’—</p>\n<p>I’ve</p>\n<p>seen gardens, compared with which</p>\n<p>this would be a wilderness.”</p>\n<p>Alice didn’t dare to argue the point, but went on: “—and I</p>\n<p>thought I’d try and find my way to the top of that hill—”</p>\n<p>“When you say ‘hill,’” the Queen interrupted,</p>\n<p>“</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>could show you hills, in comparison with which you’d call</p>\n<p>that a valley.”</p>\n<p>“No, I shouldn’t,” said Alice, surprised into contradicting</p>\n<p>her at last: “a hill</p>\n<p>can’t</p>\n<p>be a valley, you know. That would</p>\n<p>be nonsense—”</p>\n<p>The Red Queen shook her head, “You may call it ‘nonsense’ if</p>\n<p>you like,” she said, “but</p>\n<p>I’ve</p>\n<p>heard nonsense,</p>\n<p>compared with which that would be as sensible as a dictionary!”</p>\n<p>Alice curtseyed again, as she was afraid from the Queen’s tone that she</p>\n<p>was a</p>\n<p>little</p>\n<p>offended: and they walked on in silence till they got to</p>\n<p>the top of the little hill.</p>\n<p>For some minutes Alice stood without speaking, looking out in all directions</p>\n<p>over the country—and a most curious country it was. There were a number</p>\n<p>of tiny little brooks running straight across it from side to side, and the</p>\n<p>ground between was divided up into squares by a number of little green hedges,</p>\n<p>that reached from brook to brook.</p>\n<p>“I declare it’s marked out just like a large chessboard!”</p>\n<p>Alice said at last. “There ought to be some men moving about</p>\n<p>somewhere—and so there are!” She added in a tone of delight, and</p>\n<p>her heart began to beat quick with excitement as she went on. “It’s</p>\n<p>a great huge game of chess that’s being played—all over the</p>\n<p>world—if this</p>\n<p>is</p>\n<p>the world at all, you know. Oh, what fun it is!</p>\n<p>How I</p>\n<p>wish</p>\n<p>I was one of them! I wouldn’t mind being a Pawn, if</p>\n<p>only I might join—though of course I should</p>\n<p>like</p>\n<p>to be a Queen,</p>\n<p>best.”</p>\n<p>She glanced rather shyly at the real Queen as she said this, but her companion</p>\n<p>only smiled pleasantly, and said, “That’s easily managed. You can</p>\n<p>be the White Queen’s Pawn, if you like, as Lily’s too young to</p>\n<p>play; and you’re in the Second Square to begin with: when you get to the</p>\n<p>Eighth Square you’ll be a Queen—” Just at this moment,</p>\n<p>somehow or other, they began to run.</p>\n<p>Alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how it was</p>\n<p>that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand in hand, and</p>\n<p>the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep up with her: and</p>\n<p>still the Queen kept crying “Faster! Faster!” but Alice felt she</p>\n<p>could not</p>\n<p>go faster, though she had not breath left to say so.</p>\n<p>The most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other things</p>\n<p>round them never changed their places at all: however fast they went, they</p>\n<p>never seemed to pass anything. “I wonder if all the things move along</p>\n<p>with us?” thought poor puzzled Alice. And the Queen seemed to guess her</p>\n<p>thoughts, for she cried, “Faster! Don’t try to talk!”</p>\n<p>Not that Alice had any idea of doing</p>\n<p>that</p>\n<p>. She felt as if she would</p>\n<p>never be able to talk again, she was getting so much out of breath: and still</p>\n<p>the Queen cried “Faster! Faster!” and dragged her along. “Are</p>\n<p>we nearly there?” Alice managed to pant out at last.</p>\n<p>“Nearly there!” the Queen repeated. “Why, we passed it ten</p>\n<p>minutes ago! Faster!” And they ran on for a time in silence, with the</p>\n<p>wind whistling in Alice’s ears, and almost blowing her hair off her head,</p>\n<p>she fancied.</p>\n<p>“Now! Now!” cried the Queen. “Faster! Faster!” And they</p>\n<p>went so fast that at last they seemed to skim through the air, hardly touching</p>\n<p>the ground with their feet, till suddenly, just as Alice was getting quite</p>\n<p>exhausted, they stopped, and she found herself sitting on the ground,</p>\n<p>breathless and giddy.</p>\n<p>The Queen propped her up against a tree, and said kindly, “You may rest a</p>\n<p>little now.”</p>\n<p>Alice looked round her in great surprise. “Why, I do believe we’ve</p>\n<p>been under this tree the whole time! Everything’s just as it was!”</p>\n<p>“Of course it is,” said the Queen, “what would you have</p>\n<p>it?”</p>\n<p>“Well, in</p>\n<p>our</p>\n<p>country,” said Alice, still panting a little,</p>\n<p>“you’d generally get to somewhere else—if you ran very fast</p>\n<p>for a long time, as we’ve been doing.”</p>\n<p>“A slow sort of country!” said the Queen. “Now,</p>\n<p>here</p>\n<p>,</p>\n<p>you see, it takes all the running</p>\n<p>you</p>\n<p>can do, to keep in the same place.</p>\n<p>If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as</p>\n<p>that!”</p>\n<p>“I’d rather not try, please!” said Alice. “I’m</p>\n<p>quite content to stay here—only I</p>\n<p>am</p>\n<p>so hot and thirsty!”</p>\n<p>“I know what</p>\n<p>you’d</p>\n<p>like!” the Queen said</p>\n<p>good-naturedly, taking a little box out of her pocket. “Have a</p>\n<p>biscuit?”</p>\n<p>Alice thought it would not be civil to say “No,” though it</p>\n<p>wasn’t at all what she wanted. So she took it, and ate it as well as she</p>\n<p>could: and it was</p>\n<p>very</p>\n<p>dry; and she thought she had never been so nearly</p>\n<p>choked in all her life.</p>\n<p>“While you’re refreshing yourself,” said the Queen,</p>\n<p>“I’ll just take the measurements.” And she took a ribbon out</p>\n<p>of her pocket, marked in inches, and began measuring the ground, and sticking</p>\n<p>little pegs in here and there.</p>\n<p>“At the end of two yards,” she said, putting in a peg to mark the</p>\n<p>distance, “I shall give you your directions—have another</p>\n<p>biscuit?”</p>\n<p>“No, thank you,” said Alice: “one’s</p>\n<p>quite</p>\n<p>enough!”</p>\n<p>“Thirst quenched, I hope?” said the Queen.</p>\n<p>Alice did not know what to say to this, but luckily the Queen did not wait for</p>\n<p>an answer, but went on. “At the end of</p>\n<p>three</p>\n<p>yards I shall repeat</p>\n<p>them—for fear of your forgetting them. At the end of</p>\n<p>four</p>\n<p>, I shall</p>\n<p>say good-bye. And at the end of</p>\n<p>five</p>\n<p>, I shall go!”</p>\n<p>She had got all the pegs put in by this time, and Alice looked on with great</p>\n<p>interest as she returned to the tree, and then began slowly walking down the</p>\n<p>row.</p>\n<p>At the two-yard peg she faced round, and said, “A pawn goes two squares</p>\n<p>in its first move, you know. So you’ll go</p>\n<p>very</p>\n<p>quickly through the</p>\n<p>Third Square—by railway, I should think—and you’ll find</p>\n<p>yourself in the Fourth Square in no time. Well,</p>\n<p>that</p>\n<p>square belongs to</p>\n<p>Tweedledum and Tweedledee—the Fifth is mostly water—the Sixth</p>\n<p>belongs to Humpty Dumpty—But you make no remark?”</p>\n<p>“I—I didn’t know I had to make one—just then,”</p>\n<p>Alice faltered out.</p>\n<p>“You</p>\n<p>should</p>\n<p>have said, ‘It’s extremely kind of you to</p>\n<p>tell me all this’—however, we’ll suppose it said—the</p>\n<p>Seventh Square is all forest—however, one of the Knights will show you</p>\n<p>the way—and in the Eighth Square we shall be Queens together, and</p>\n<p>it’s all feasting and fun!” Alice got up and curtseyed, and sat</p>\n<p>down again.</p>\n<p>At the next peg the Queen turned again, and this time she said, “Speak in</p>\n<p>French when you can’t think of the English for a thing—turn out</p>\n<p>your toes as you walk—and remember who you are!” She did not wait</p>\n<p>for Alice to curtsey this time, but walked on quickly to the next peg, where</p>\n<p>she turned for a moment to say “good-bye,” and then hurried on to</p>\n<p>the last.</p>\n<p>How it happened, Alice never knew, but exactly as she came to the last peg, she</p>\n<p>was gone. Whether she vanished into the air, or whether she ran quickly into</p>\n<p>the wood (“and she</p>\n<p>can</p>\n<p>run very fast!” thought Alice), there</p>\n<p>was no way of guessing, but she was gone, and Alice began to remember that she</p>\n<p>was a Pawn, and that it would soon be time for her to move.</p>\n"
