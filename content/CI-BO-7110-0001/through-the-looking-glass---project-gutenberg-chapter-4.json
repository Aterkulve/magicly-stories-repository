  "content": "<p>Tweedledum And Tweedledee</p>\n<p>They were standing under a tree, each with an arm round the other’s neck,</p>\n<p>and Alice knew which was which in a moment, because one of them had</p>\n<p>“DUM” embroidered on his collar, and the other “DEE.”</p>\n<p>“I suppose they’ve each got ‘TWEEDLE’ round at the back</p>\n<p>of the collar,” she said to herself.</p>\n<p>They stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive, and she was just</p>\n<p>looking round to see if the word ‘TWEEDLE’ was written at the back</p>\n<p>of each collar, when she was startled by a voice coming from the one marked</p>\n<p>“DUM.”</p>\n<p>“If you think we’re wax-works,” he said, “you ought to</p>\n<p>pay, you know. Wax-works weren’t made to be looked at for nothing,</p>\n<p>nohow!”</p>\n<p>“Contrariwise,” added the one marked “DEE,” “if</p>\n<p>you think we’re alive, you ought to speak.”</p>\n<p>“I’m sure I’m very sorry,” was all Alice could say; for</p>\n<p>the words of the old song kept ringing through her head like the ticking of a</p>\n<p>clock, and she could hardly help saying them out loud:—</p>\n<p>“Tweedledum and Tweedledee</p>\n<p>Agreed to have a battle;</p>\n<p>For Tweedledum said Tweedledee</p>\n<p>Had spoiled his nice new rattle.</p>\n<p>Just then flew down a monstrous crow,</p>\n<p>As black as a tar-barrel;</p>\n<p>Which frightened both the heroes so,</p>\n<p>They quite forgot their quarrel.”</p>\n<p>“I know what you’re thinking about,” said Tweedledum:</p>\n<p>“but it isn’t so, nohow.”</p>\n<p>“Contrariwise,” continued Tweedledee, “if it was so, it might</p>\n<p>be; and if it were so, it would be; but as it isn’t, it ain’t.</p>\n<p>That’s logic.”</p>\n<p>“I was thinking,” Alice said very politely, “which is the</p>\n<p>best way out of this wood: it’s getting so dark. Would you tell me,</p>\n<p>please?”</p>\n<p>But the little men only looked at each other and grinned.</p>\n<p>They looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys, that Alice</p>\n<p>couldn’t help pointing her finger at Tweedledum, and saying “First</p>\n<p>Boy!”</p>\n<p>“Nohow!” Tweedledum cried out briskly, and shut his mouth up again</p>\n<p>with a snap.</p>\n<p>“Next Boy!” said Alice, passing on to Tweedledee, though she felt</p>\n<p>quite certain he would only shout out “Contrariwise!” and so he</p>\n<p>did.</p>\n<p>“You’ve been wrong!” cried Tweedledum. “The first thing</p>\n<p>in a visit is to say ‘How d’ye do?’ and shake hands!”</p>\n<p>And here the two brothers gave each other a hug, and then they held out the two</p>\n<p>hands that were free, to shake hands with her.</p>\n<p>Alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first, for fear of hurting</p>\n<p>the other one’s feelings; so, as the best way out of the difficulty, she</p>\n<p>took hold of both hands at once: the next moment they were dancing round in a</p>\n<p>ring. This seemed quite natural (she remembered afterwards), and she was not</p>\n<p>even surprised to hear music playing: it seemed to come from the tree under</p>\n<p>which they were dancing, and it was done (as well as she could make it out) by</p>\n<p>the branches rubbing one across the other, like fiddles and fiddle-sticks.</p>\n<p>“But it certainly</p>\n<p>was</p>\n<p>funny,” (Alice said afterwards, when</p>\n<p>she was telling her sister the history of all this,) “to find myself</p>\n<p>singing ‘</p>\n<p>Here we go round the mulberry bush</p>\n<p>.’ I don’t</p>\n<p>know when I began it, but somehow I felt as if I’d been singing it a long</p>\n<p>long time!”</p>\n<p>The other two dancers were fat, and very soon out of breath. “Four times</p>\n<p>round is enough for one dance,” Tweedledum panted out, and they left off</p>\n<p>dancing as suddenly as they had begun: the music stopped at the same moment.</p>\n<p>Then they let go of Alice’s hands, and stood looking at her for a minute:</p>\n<p>there was a rather awkward pause, as Alice didn’t know how to begin a</p>\n<p>conversation with people she had just been dancing with. “It would never</p>\n<p>do to say ‘How d’ye do?’</p>\n<p>now</p>\n<p>,” she said to</p>\n<p>herself: “we seem to have got beyond that, somehow!”</p>\n<p>“I hope you’re not much tired?” she said at last.</p>\n<p>“Nohow. And thank you</p>\n<p>very</p>\n<p>much for asking,” said</p>\n<p>Tweedledum.</p>\n<p>“So</p>\n<p>much</p>\n<p>obliged!” added Tweedledee. “You like</p>\n<p>poetry?”</p>\n<p>“Ye-es, pretty well—</p>\n<p>some</p>\n<p>poetry,” Alice said</p>\n<p>doubtfully. “Would you tell me which road leads out of the wood?”</p>\n<p>“What shall I repeat to her?” said Tweedledee, looking round at</p>\n<p>Tweedledum with great solemn eyes, and not noticing Alice’s question.</p>\n<p>“‘</p>\n<p>The Walrus and the Carpenter</p>\n<p>’ is the longest,”</p>\n<p>Tweedledum replied, giving his brother an affectionate hug.</p>\n<p>Tweedledee began instantly:</p>\n<p>“The sun was shining—”</p>\n<p>Here Alice ventured to interrupt him. “If it’s</p>\n<p>very</p>\n<p>long,” she said, as politely as she could, “would you please tell</p>\n<p>me first which road—”</p>\n<p>Tweedledee smiled gently, and began again:</p>\n<p>“The sun was shining on the sea,</p>\n<p>Shining with all his might:</p>\n<p>He did his very best to make</p>\n<p>The billows smooth and bright—</p>\n<p>And this was odd, because it was</p>\n<p>The middle of the night.</p>\n<p>The moon was shining sulkily,</p>\n<p>Because she thought the sun</p>\n<p>Had got no business to be there</p>\n<p>After the day was done—</p>\n<p>‘It’s very rude of him,’ she said,</p>\n<p>‘To come and spoil the fun!’</p>\n<p>The sea was wet as wet could be,</p>\n<p>The sands were dry as dry.</p>\n<p>You could not see a cloud, because</p>\n<p>No cloud was in the sky:</p>\n<p>No birds were flying over head—</p>\n<p>There were no birds to fly.</p>\n<p>The Walrus and the Carpenter</p>\n<p>Were walking close at hand;</p>\n<p>They wept like anything to see</p>\n<p>Such quantities of sand:</p>\n<p>‘If this were only cleared away,’</p>\n<p>They said, ‘it</p>\n<p>would</p>\n<p>be grand!’</p>\n<p>‘If seven maids with seven mops</p>\n<p>Swept it for half a year,</p>\n<p>Do you suppose,’ the Walrus said,</p>\n<p>‘That they could get it clear?’</p>\n<p>‘I doubt it,’ said the Carpenter,</p>\n<p>And shed a bitter tear.</p>\n<p>‘O Oysters, come and walk with us!’</p>\n<p>The Walrus did beseech.</p>\n<p>‘A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,</p>\n<p>Along the briny beach:</p>\n<p>We cannot do with more than four,</p>\n<p>To give a hand to each.’</p>\n<p>The eldest Oyster looked at him.</p>\n<p>But never a word he said:</p>\n<p>The eldest Oyster winked his eye,</p>\n<p>And shook his heavy head—</p>\n<p>Meaning to say he did not choose</p>\n<p>To leave the oyster-bed.</p>\n<p>But four young oysters hurried up,</p>\n<p>All eager for the treat:</p>\n<p>Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,</p>\n<p>Their shoes were clean and neat—</p>\n<p>And this was odd, because, you know,</p>\n<p>They hadn’t any feet.</p>\n<p>Four other Oysters followed them,</p>\n<p>And yet another four;</p>\n<p>And thick and fast they came at last,</p>\n<p>And more, and more, and more—</p>\n<p>All hopping through the frothy waves,</p>\n<p>And scrambling to the shore.</p>\n<p>The Walrus and the Carpenter</p>\n<p>Walked on a mile or so,</p>\n<p>And then they rested on a rock</p>\n<p>Conveniently low:</p>\n<p>And all the little Oysters stood</p>\n<p>And waited in a row.</p>\n<p>‘The time has come,’ the Walrus said,</p>\n<p>‘To talk of many things:</p>\n<p>Of shoes—and ships—and sealing-wax—</p>\n<p>Of cabbages—and kings—</p>\n<p>And why the sea is boiling hot—</p>\n<p>And whether pigs have wings.’</p>\n<p>‘But wait a bit,’ the Oysters cried,</p>\n<p>‘Before we have our chat;</p>\n<p>For some of us are out of breath,</p>\n<p>And all of us are fat!’</p>\n<p>‘No hurry!’ said the Carpenter.</p>\n<p>They thanked him much for that.</p>\n<p>‘A loaf of bread,’ the Walrus said,</p>\n<p>‘Is what we chiefly need:</p>\n<p>Pepper and vinegar besides</p>\n<p>Are very good indeed—</p>\n<p>Now if you’re ready Oysters dear,</p>\n<p>We can begin to feed.’</p>\n<p>‘But not on us!’ the Oysters cried,</p>\n<p>Turning a little blue,</p>\n<p>‘After such kindness, that would be</p>\n<p>A dismal thing to do!’</p>\n<p>‘The night is fine,’ the Walrus said</p>\n<p>‘Do you admire the view?</p>\n<p>‘It was so kind of you to come!</p>\n<p>And you are very nice!’</p>\n<p>The Carpenter said nothing but</p>\n<p>‘Cut us another slice:</p>\n<p>I wish you were not quite so deaf—</p>\n<p>I’ve had to ask you twice!’</p>\n<p>‘It seems a shame,’ the Walrus said,</p>\n<p>‘To play them such a trick,</p>\n<p>After we’ve brought them out so far,</p>\n<p>And made them trot so quick!’</p>\n<p>The Carpenter said nothing but</p>\n<p>‘The butter’s spread too thick!’</p>\n<p>‘I weep for you,’ the Walrus said.</p>\n<p>‘I deeply sympathize.’</p>\n<p>With sobs and tears he sorted out</p>\n<p>Those of the largest size.</p>\n<p>Holding his pocket handkerchief</p>\n<p>Before his streaming eyes.</p>\n<p>‘O Oysters,’ said the Carpenter.</p>\n<p>‘You’ve had a pleasant run!</p>\n<p>Shall we be trotting home again?’</p>\n<p>But answer came there none—</p>\n<p>And that was scarcely odd, because</p>\n<p>They’d eaten every one.”</p>\n<p>“I like the Walrus best,” said Alice: “because you see he was</p>\n<p>a</p>\n<p>little</p>\n<p>sorry for the poor oysters.”</p>\n<p>“He ate more than the Carpenter, though,” said Tweedledee.</p>\n<p>“You see he held his handkerchief in front, so that the Carpenter</p>\n<p>couldn’t count how many he took: contrariwise.”</p>\n<p>“That was mean!” Alice said indignantly. “Then I like the</p>\n<p>Carpenter best—if he didn’t eat so many as the Walrus.”</p>\n<p>“But he ate as many as he could get,” said Tweedledum.</p>\n<p>This was a puzzler. After a pause, Alice began, “Well! They were</p>\n<p>both</p>\n<p>very unpleasant characters—” Here she checked herself</p>\n<p>in some alarm, at hearing something that sounded to her like the puffing of a</p>\n<p>large steam-engine in the wood near them, though she feared it was more likely</p>\n<p>to be a wild beast. “Are there any lions or tigers about here?” she</p>\n<p>asked timidly.</p>\n<p>“It’s only the Red King snoring,” said Tweedledee.</p>\n<p>“Come and look at him!” the brothers cried, and they each took one</p>\n<p>of Alice’s hands, and led her up to where the King was sleeping.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t he a</p>\n<p>lovely</p>\n<p>sight?” said Tweedledum.</p>\n<p>Alice couldn’t say honestly that he was. He had a tall red night-cap on,</p>\n<p>with a tassel, and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy heap, and</p>\n<p>snoring loud—“fit to snore his head off!” as Tweedledum</p>\n<p>remarked.</p>\n<p>“I’m afraid he’ll catch cold with lying on the damp</p>\n<p>grass,” said Alice, who was a very thoughtful little girl.</p>\n<p>“He’s dreaming now,” said Tweedledee: “and what do you</p>\n<p>think he’s dreaming about?”</p>\n<p>Alice said “Nobody can guess that.”</p>\n<p>“Why, about</p>\n<p>you</p>\n<p>!” Tweedledee exclaimed, clapping his hands</p>\n<p>triumphantly. “And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you</p>\n<p>suppose you’d be?”</p>\n<p>“Where I am now, of course,” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“Not you!” Tweedledee retorted contemptuously. “You’d</p>\n<p>be nowhere. Why, you’re only a sort of thing in his dream!”</p>\n<p>“If that there King was to wake,” added Tweedledum,</p>\n<p>“you’d go out—bang!—just like a candle!”</p>\n<p>“I shouldn’t!” Alice exclaimed indignantly. “Besides,</p>\n<p>if</p>\n<p>I’m</p>\n<p>only a sort of thing in his dream, what are</p>\n<p>you</p>\n<p>, I</p>\n<p>should like to know?”</p>\n<p>“Ditto” said Tweedledum.</p>\n<p>“Ditto, ditto” cried Tweedledee.</p>\n<p>He shouted this so loud that Alice couldn’t help saying, “Hush!</p>\n<p>You’ll be waking him, I’m afraid, if you make so much noise.”</p>\n<p>“Well, it no use</p>\n<p>your</p>\n<p>talking about waking him,” said</p>\n<p>Tweedledum, “when you’re only one of the things in his dream. You</p>\n<p>know very well you’re not real.”</p>\n<p>“I</p>\n<p>am</p>\n<p>real!” said Alice and began to cry.</p>\n<p>“You won’t make yourself a bit realler by crying,” Tweedledee</p>\n<p>remarked: “there’s nothing to cry about.”</p>\n<p>“If I wasn’t real,” Alice said—half-laughing through</p>\n<p>her tears, it all seemed so ridiculous—“I shouldn’t be able</p>\n<p>to cry.”</p>\n<p>“I hope you don’t suppose those are real tears?” Tweedledum</p>\n<p>interrupted in a tone of great contempt.</p>\n<p>“I know they’re talking nonsense,” Alice thought to herself:</p>\n<p>“and it’s foolish to cry about it.” So she brushed away her</p>\n<p>tears, and went on as cheerfully as she could. “At any rate I’d</p>\n<p>better be getting out of the wood, for really it’s coming on very dark.</p>\n<p>Do you think it’s going to rain?”</p>\n<p>Tweedledum spread a large umbrella over himself and his brother, and looked up</p>\n<p>into it. “No, I don’t think it is,” he said: “at</p>\n<p>least—not under</p>\n<p>here</p>\n<p>. Nohow.”</p>\n<p>“But it may rain</p>\n<p>outside</p>\n<p>?”</p>\n<p>“It may—if it chooses,” said Tweedledee: “we’ve</p>\n<p>no objection. Contrariwise.”</p>\n<p>“Selfish things!” thought Alice, and she was just going to say</p>\n<p>“Good-night” and leave them, when Tweedledum sprang out from under</p>\n<p>the umbrella and seized her by the wrist.</p>\n<p>“Do you see</p>\n<p>that</p>\n<p>?” he said, in a voice choking with passion,</p>\n<p>and his eyes grew large and yellow all in a moment, as he pointed with a</p>\n<p>trembling finger at a small white thing lying under the tree.</p>\n<p>“It’s only a rattle,” Alice said, after a careful examination</p>\n<p>of the little white thing. “Not a rattle-</p>\n<p>snake</p>\n<p>, you know,”</p>\n<p>she added hastily, thinking that he was frightened: “only an old</p>\n<p>rattle—quite old and broken.”</p>\n<p>“I knew it was!” cried Tweedledum, beginning to stamp about wildly</p>\n<p>and tear his hair. “It’s spoilt, of course!” Here he looked</p>\n<p>at Tweedledee, who immediately sat down on the ground, and tried to hide</p>\n<p>himself under the umbrella.</p>\n<p>Alice laid her hand upon his arm, and said in a soothing tone, “You</p>\n<p>needn’t be so angry about an old rattle.”</p>\n<p>“But it isn’t old!” Tweedledum cried, in a greater fury than</p>\n<p>ever. “It’s new, I tell you—I bought it yesterday—my</p>\n<p>nice new RATTLE!” and his voice rose to a perfect scream.</p>\n<p>All this time Tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella, with</p>\n<p>himself in it: which was such an extraordinary thing to do, that it quite took</p>\n<p>off Alice’s attention from the angry brother. But he couldn’t quite</p>\n<p>succeed, and it ended in his rolling over, bundled up in the umbrella, with</p>\n<p>only his head out: and there he lay, opening and shutting his mouth and his</p>\n<p>large eyes—“looking more like a fish than anything else,”</p>\n<p>Alice thought.</p>\n<p>“Of course you agree to have a battle?” Tweedledum said in a calmer</p>\n<p>tone.</p>\n<p>“I suppose so,” the other sulkily replied, as he crawled out of the</p>\n<p>umbrella: “only</p>\n<p>she</p>\n<p>must help us to dress up, you know.”</p>\n<p>So the two brothers went off hand-in-hand into the wood, and returned in a</p>\n<p>minute with their arms full of things—such as bolsters, blankets,</p>\n<p>hearth-rugs, table-cloths, dish-covers and coal-scuttles. “I hope</p>\n<p>you’re a good hand at pinning and tying strings?” Tweedledum</p>\n<p>remarked. “Every one of these things has got to go on, somehow or</p>\n<p>other.”</p>\n<p>Alice said afterwards she had never seen such a fuss made about anything in all</p>\n<p>her life—the way those two bustled about—and the quantity of things</p>\n<p>they put on—and the trouble they gave her in tying strings and fastening</p>\n<p>buttons—“Really they’ll be more like bundles of old clothes</p>\n<p>than anything else, by the time they’re ready!” she said to</p>\n<p>herself, as she arranged a bolster round the neck of Tweedledee, “to keep</p>\n<p>his head from being cut off,” as he said.</p>\n<p>“You know,” he added very gravely, “it’s one of the</p>\n<p>most serious things that can possibly happen to one in a battle—to get</p>\n<p>one’s head cut off.”</p>\n<p>Alice laughed aloud: but she managed to turn it into a cough, for fear of</p>\n<p>hurting his feelings.</p>\n<p>“Do I look very pale?” said Tweedledum, coming up to have his</p>\n<p>helmet tied on. (He</p>\n<p>called</p>\n<p>it a helmet, though it certainly looked much</p>\n<p>more like a saucepan.)</p>\n<p>“Well—yes—a</p>\n<p>little</p>\n<p>,” Alice replied gently.</p>\n<p>“I’m very brave generally,” he went on in a low voice:</p>\n<p>“only to-day I happen to have a headache.”</p>\n<p>“And</p>\n<p>I’ve</p>\n<p>got a toothache!” said Tweedledee, who had</p>\n<p>overheard the remark. “I’m far worse off than you!”</p>\n<p>“Then you’d better not fight to-day,” said Alice, thinking it</p>\n<p>a good opportunity to make peace.</p>\n<p>“We</p>\n<p>must</p>\n<p>have a bit of a fight, but I don’t care about going</p>\n<p>on long,” said Tweedledum. “What’s the time now?”</p>\n<p>Tweedledee looked at his watch, and said “Half-past four.”</p>\n<p>“Let’s fight till six, and then have dinner,” said</p>\n<p>Tweedledum.</p>\n<p>“Very well,” the other said, rather sadly: “and</p>\n<p>she</p>\n<p>can watch us—only you’d better not come</p>\n<p>very</p>\n<p>close,”</p>\n<p>he added: “I generally hit everything I can see—when I get really</p>\n<p>excited.”</p>\n<p>“And</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>hit everything within reach,” cried Tweedledum,</p>\n<p>“whether I can see it or not!”</p>\n<p>Alice laughed. “You must hit the</p>\n<p>trees</p>\n<p>pretty often, I should</p>\n<p>think,” she said.</p>\n<p>Tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile. “I don’t</p>\n<p>suppose,” he said, “there’ll be a tree left standing, for</p>\n<p>ever so far round, by the time we’ve finished!”</p>\n<p>“And all about a rattle!” said Alice, still hoping to make them a</p>\n<p>little</p>\n<p>ashamed of fighting for such a trifle.</p>\n<p>“I shouldn’t have minded it so much,” said Tweedledum,</p>\n<p>“if it hadn’t been a new one.”</p>\n<p>“I wish the monstrous crow would come!” thought Alice.</p>\n<p>“There’s only one sword, you know,” Tweedledum said to his</p>\n<p>brother: “but you can have the umbrella—it’s quite as sharp.</p>\n<p>Only we must begin quick. It’s getting as dark as it can.”</p>\n<p>“And darker,” said Tweedledee.</p>\n<p>It was getting dark so suddenly that Alice thought there must be a thunderstorm</p>\n<p>coming on. “What a thick black cloud that is!” she said. “And</p>\n<p>how fast it comes! Why, I do believe it’s got wings!”</p>\n<p>“It’s the crow!” Tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of</p>\n<p>alarm: and the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a</p>\n<p>moment.</p>\n<p>Alice ran a little way into the wood, and stopped under a large tree. “It</p>\n<p>can never get at me</p>\n<p>here</p>\n<p>,” she thought: “it’s far too</p>\n<p>large to squeeze itself in among the trees. But I wish it wouldn’t flap</p>\n<p>its wings so—it makes quite a hurricane in the wood—here’s</p>\n<p>somebody’s shawl being blown away!”</p>\n"
