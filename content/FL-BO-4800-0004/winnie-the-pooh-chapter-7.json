  "content": "<p>Eeyore, the old grey Donkey, stood by the side of the stream, and\nlooked at himself in the water.</p>\n<p>\"Pathetic,\" he said. \"That's what it is. Pathetic.\"</p>\n<p>He turned and walked slowly down the stream for twenty yards, splashed\nacross it, and walked slowly back on the other side. Then he looked at\nhimself in the water again.</p>\n<p>\"As I thought,\" he said. \"No better fromthisside. But nobody minds.\nNobody cares. Pathetic, that's what it is.\"</p>\n<p>There was a crackling noise in the bracken behind him, and out came\nPooh.</p>\n<p>\"Good morning, Eeyore,\" said Pooh.</p>\n<p>\"Good morning, Pooh Bear,\" said Eeyore gloomily. \"If itisa good\nmorning,\" he said. \"Which I doubt,\" said he.</p>\n<p>\"Why, what's the matter?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nothing, Pooh Bear, nothing. We can't all, and some of us don't. That's\nall there is to it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Can't allwhat?\" said Pooh, rubbing his nose.</p>\n<p>\"Gaiety. Song-and-dance. Here we go round the mulberry bush.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh!\" said Pooh. He thought for a long time, and then asked, \"What\nmulberry bush is that?\"</p>\n<p>\"Bon-hommy,\" went on Eeyore gloomily. \"French word meaning bonhommy,\" he\nexplained. \"I'm not complaining, but There It Is.\"</p>\n<p>Pooh sat down on a large stone, and tried to think this out. It sounded\nto him like a riddle, and he was never much good at riddles, being a\nBear of Very Little Brain. So he sangCottleston Pieinstead:</p>\n<p>That was the first verse. When he had finished it, Eeyore didn't\nactually say that he didn't like it, so Pooh very kindly sang the second\nverse to him:</p>\n<p>Eeyore still said nothing at all, so Pooh hummed the third verse quietly\nto himself:</p>\n<p>\"That's right,\" said Eeyore. \"Sing. Umty-tiddly, umty-too. Here we go\ngathering Nuts and May. Enjoy yourself.\"</p>\n<p>\"I am,\" said Pooh.</p>\n<p>\"Some can,\" said Eeyore.</p>\n<p>\"Why, what's the matter?\"</p>\n<p>\"Isanything the matter?\"</p>\n<p>\"You seem so sad, Eeyore.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sad? Why should I be sad? It's my birthday. The happiest day of the\nyear.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your birthday?\" said Pooh in great surprise.</p>\n<p>\"Of course it is. Can't you see? Look at all the presents I have had.\"\nHe waved a foot from side to side. \"Look at the birthday cake. Candles\nand pink sugar.\"</p>\n<p>Pooh looked—first to the right and then to the left.</p>\n<p>\"Presents?\" said Pooh. \"Birthday cake?\" said Pooh. \"Where?\"</p>\n<p>\"Can't you see them?\"</p>\n<p>\"No,\" said Pooh.</p>\n<p>\"Neither can I,\" said Eeyore. \"Joke,\" he explained. \"Ha ha!\"</p>\n<p>Pooh scratched his head, being a little puzzled by all this.</p>\n<p>\"But is it really your birthday?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>\"It is.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh! Well, Many happy returns of the day, Eeyore.\"</p>\n<p>\"And many happy returns to you, Pooh Bear.\"</p>\n<p>\"But it isn'tmybirthday.\"</p>\n<p>\"No, it's mine.\"</p>\n<p>\"But you said 'Many happy returns'——\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, why not? You don't always want to be miserable on my birthday, do\nyou?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, I see,\" said Pooh.</p>\n<p>\"It's bad enough,\" said Eeyore, almost breaking down, \"being miserable\nmyself, what with no presents and no cake and no candles, and no proper\nnotice taken of me at all, but if everybody else is going to be\nmiserable too——\"</p>\n<p>This was too much for Pooh. \"Stay there!\" he called to Eeyore, as he\nturned and hurried back home as quick as he could; for he felt that he\nmust get poor Eeyore a present ofsomesort at once, and he could\nalways think of a proper one afterwards.</p>\n<p>Outside his house he found Piglet, jumping up and down trying to reach\nthe knocker.</p>\n<p>\"Hallo, Piglet,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Hallo, Pooh,\" said Piglet.</p>\n<p>\"What areyoutrying to do?\"</p>\n<p>\"I was trying to reach the knocker,\" said Piglet. \"I just came\nround——\"</p>\n<p>\"Let me do it for you,\" said Pooh kindly. So he reached up and knocked\nat the door. \"I have just seen Eeyore,\" he began, \"and poor Eeyore is in\na Very Sad Condition, because it's his birthday, and nobody has taken\nany notice of it, and he's very Gloomy—you know what Eeyore is—and\nthere he was, and——What a long time whoever lives here is answering\nthis door.\" And he knocked again.</p>\n<p>\"But Pooh,\" said Piglet, \"it's your own house!\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh!\" said Pooh. \"So it is,\" he said. \"Well, let's go in.\"</p>\n<p>So in they went. The first thing Pooh did was to go to the cupboard to\nsee if he had quite a small jar of honey left; and he had, so he took it\ndown.</p>\n<p>\"I'm giving this to Eeyore,\" he explained, \"as a present. What areyougoing to give?\"</p>\n<p>\"Couldn't I give it too?\" said Piglet. \"From both of us?\"</p>\n<p>\"No,\" said Pooh. \"That wouldnotbe a good plan.\"</p>\n<p>\"All right, then, I'll give him a balloon. I've got one left from my\nparty. I'll go and get it now, shall I?\"</p>\n<p>\"That, Piglet, is averygood idea. It is just what Eeyore wants to\ncheer him up. Nobody can be uncheered with a balloon.\"</p>\n<p>So off Piglet trotted; and in the other direction went Pooh, with his\njar of honey.</p>\n<p>It was a warm day, and he had a long way to go. He hadn't gone more than\nhalf-way when a sort of funny feeling began to creep all over him. It\nbegan at the tip of his nose and trickled all through him and out at the\nsoles of his feet. It was just as if somebody inside him were saying,\n\"Now then, Pooh, time for a little something.\"</p>\n<p>\"Dear, dear,\" said Pooh, \"I didn't know it was as late as that.\" So he\nsat down and took the top off his jar of honey. \"Lucky I brought this\nwith me,\" he thought. \"Many a bear going out on a warm day like this\nwould never have thought of bringing a little something with him.\" And\nhe began to eat.</p>\n<p>\"Now let me see,\" he thought, as he took his last lick of the inside of\nthe jar, \"where was I going? Ah, yes, Eeyore.\" He got up slowly.</p>\n<p>And then, suddenly, he remembered. He had eaten Eeyore's birthday\npresent!</p>\n<p>\"Bother!\" said Pooh. \"WhatshallI do? Imustgive himsomething.\"</p>\n<p>For a little while he couldn't think of anything. Then he thought:\n\"Well, it's a very nice pot, even if there's no honey in it, and if I\nwashed it clean, and got somebody to write 'A Happy Birthday' on it,\nEeyore could keep things in it, which might be Useful.\" So, as he was\njust passing the Hundred Acre Wood, he went inside to call on Owl, who\nlived there.</p>\n<p>\"Good morning, Owl,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Good morning, Pooh,\" said Owl.</p>\n<p>\"Many happy returns of Eeyore's birthday,\" said Pooh.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, is that what it is?\"</p>\n<p>\"What are you giving him, Owl?\"</p>\n<p>\"What areyougiving him, Pooh?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm giving him a Useful Pot to Keep Things In, and I wanted to ask\nyou——\"</p>\n<p>\"Is this it?\" said Owl, taking it out of Pooh's paw.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, and I wanted to ask you——\"</p>\n<p>\"Somebody has been keeping honey in it,\" said Owl.</p>\n<p>\"You can keepanythingin it,\" said Pooh earnestly. \"It's Very Useful\nlike that. And I wanted to ask you——\"</p>\n<p>\"You ought to write 'A Happy Birthday' on it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thatwas what I wanted to ask you,\" said Pooh. \"Because my spelling\nis Wobbly. It's good spelling but it Wobbles, and the letters get in the\nwrong places. Wouldyouwrite 'A Happy Birthday' on it for me?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's a nice pot,\" said Owl, looking at it all round. \"Couldn't I give\nit too? From both of us?\"</p>\n<p>\"No,\" said Pooh. \"That wouldnotbe a good plan. Now I'll just wash it\nfirst, and then you can write on it.\"</p>\n<p>Well, he washed the pot out, and dried it, while Owl licked the end of\nhis pencil, and wondered how to spell \"birthday.\"</p>\n<p>\"Can you read, Pooh?\" he asked a little anxiously. \"There's a notice\nabout knocking and ringing outside my door, which Christopher Robin\nwrote. Could you read it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Christopher Robin told me what it said, andthenI could.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, I'll tell you whatthissays, and then you'll be able to.\"</p>\n<p>So Owl wrote ... and this is what he wrote:</p>\n<p>HIPY PAPY BTHUTHDTH THUTHDA BTHUTHDY.</p>\n<p>Pooh looked on admiringly.</p>\n<p>\"I'm just saying 'A Happy Birthday',\" said Owl carelessly.</p>\n<p>\"It's a nice long one,\" said Pooh, very much impressed by it.</p>\n<p>\"Well,actually, of course, I'm saying 'A Very Happy Birthday with\nlove from Pooh.' Naturally it takes a good deal of pencil to say a long\nthing like that.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, I see,\" said Pooh.</p>\n<p>While all this was happening, Piglet had gone back to his own house to\nget Eeyore's balloon. He held it very tightly against himself, so that\nit shouldn't blow away, and he ran as fast as he could so as to get to\nEeyore before Pooh did; for he thought that he would like to be the\nfirst one to give a present, just as if he had thought of it without\nbeing told by anybody. And running along, and thinking how pleased\nEeyore would be, he didn't look where he was going ... and suddenly he\nput his foot in a rabbit hole, and fell down flat on his face.</p>\n<p>BANG!!!???***!!!</p>\n<p>Piglet lay there, wondering what had happened. At first he thought that\nthe whole world had blown up; and then he thought that perhaps only the\nForest part of it had; and then he thought that perhaps onlyhehad,\nand he was now alone in the moon or somewhere, and would never see\nChristopher Robin or Pooh or Eeyore again. And then he thought, \"Well,\neven if I'm in the moon, I needn't be face downwards all the time,\" so\nhe got cautiously up and looked about him.</p>\n<p>He was still in the Forest!</p>\n<p>\"Well, that's funny,\" he thought. \"I wonder what that bang was. I\ncouldn't have made such a noise just falling down. And where's my\nballoon? And what's that small piece of damp rag doing?\"</p>\n<p>It was the balloon!</p>\n<p>\"Oh, dear!\" said Piglet \"Oh, dear, oh, dearie, dearie, dear! Well, it's\ntoo late now. I can't go back, and I haven't another balloon, and\nperhaps Eeyore doesn'tlikeballoons soverymuch.\"</p>\n<p>So he trotted on, rather sadly now, and down he came to the side of the\nstream where Eeyore was, and called out to him.</p>\n<p>\"Good morning, Eeyore,\" shouted Piglet.</p>\n<p>\"Good morning, Little Piglet,\" said Eeyore. \"If itisa good morning,\"\nhe said. \"Which I doubt,\" said he. \"Not that it matters,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Many happy returns of the day,\" said Piglet, having now got closer.</p>\n<p>Eeyore stopped looking at himself in the stream, and turned to stare at\nPiglet.</p>\n<p>\"Just say that again,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Many hap——\"</p>\n<p>\"Wait a moment.\"</p>\n<p>Balancing on three legs, he began to bring his fourth leg very\ncautiously up to his ear. \"I did this yesterday,\" he explained, as he\nfell down for the third time. \"It's quite easy. It's so as I can hear\nbetter.... There, that's done it! Now then, what were you saying?\" He\npushed his ear forward with his hoof.</p>\n<p>\"Many happy returns of the day,\" said Piglet again.</p>\n<p>\"Meaning me?\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course, Eeyore.\"</p>\n<p>\"My birthday?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Me having a real birthday?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Eeyore, and I've brought you a present.\"</p>\n<p>Eeyore took down his right hoof from his right ear, turned round, and\nwith great difficulty put up his left hoof.</p>\n<p>\"I must have that in the other ear,\" he said. \"Now then.\"</p>\n<p>\"A present,\" said Piglet very loudly.</p>\n<p>\"Meaning me again?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>\"My birthday still?\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course, Eeyore.\"</p>\n<p>\"Me going on having a real birthday?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Eeyore, and I brought you a balloon.\"</p>\n<p>\"Balloon?\" said Eeyore. \"You did say balloon? One of those big\ncoloured things you blow up? Gaiety, song-and-dance, here we are and\nthere we are?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, but I'm afraid—I'm very sorry, Eeyore—but when I was running\nalong to bring it you, I fell down.\"</p>\n<p>\"Dear, dear, how unlucky! You ran too fast, I expect. You didn't hurt\nyourself, Little Piglet?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, but I—I—oh, Eeyore, I burst the balloon!\"</p>\n<p>There was a very long silence.</p>\n<p>\"My balloon?\" said Eeyore at last.</p>\n<p>Piglet nodded.</p>\n<p>\"My birthday balloon?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Eeyore,\" said Piglet sniffing a little. \"Here it is. With—with\nmany happy returns of the day.\" And he gave Eeyore the small piece of\ndamp rag.</p>\n<p>\"Is this it?\" said Eeyore, a little surprised.</p>\n<p>Piglet nodded.</p>\n<p>\"My present?\"</p>\n<p>Piglet nodded again.</p>\n<p>\"The balloon?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, Piglet,\" said Eeyore. \"You don't mind my asking,\" he went\non, \"but what colour was this balloon when it—when itwasa balloon?\"</p>\n<p>\"Red.\"</p>\n<p>\"I just wondered.... Red,\" he murmured to himself. \"My favourite\ncolour.... How big was it?\"</p>\n<p>\"About as big as me.\"</p>\n<p>\"I just wondered.... About as big as Piglet,\" he said to himself\nsadly. \"My favourite size. Well, well.\"</p>\n<p>Piglet felt very miserable, and didn't know what to say. He was still\nopening his mouth to begin something, and then deciding that it wasn't\nany good sayingthat, when he heard a shout from the other side of the\nriver, and there was Pooh.</p>\n<p>\"Many happy returns of the day,\" called out Pooh, forgetting that he had\nsaid it already.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, Pooh, I'm having them,\" said Eeyore gloomily.</p>\n<p>\"I've brought you a little present,\" said Pooh excitedly.</p>\n<p>\"I've had it,\" said Eeyore.</p>\n<p>Pooh had now splashed across the stream to Eeyore, and Piglet was\nsitting a little way off, his head in his paws, snuffling to himself.</p>\n<p>\"It's a Useful Pot,\" said Pooh. \"Here it is. And it's got 'A Very Happy\nBirthday with love from Pooh' written on it. That's what all that\nwriting is. And it's for putting things in. There!\"</p>\n<p>When Eeyore saw the pot, he became quite excited.</p>\n<p>\"Why!\" he said. \"I believe my Balloon will just go into that Pot!\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, no, Eeyore,\" said Pooh. \"Balloons are much too big to go into Pots.\nWhat you do with a balloon is, you hold the ballon——\"</p>\n<p>\"Not mine,\" said Eeyore proudly. \"Look, Piglet!\" And as Piglet looked\nsorrowfully round, Eeyore picked the balloon up with his teeth, and\nplaced it carefully in the pot; picked it out and put it on the ground;\nand then picked it up again and put it carefully back.</p>\n<p>\"So it does!\" said Pooh. \"It goes in!\"</p>\n<p>\"So it does!\" said Piglet. \"And it comes out!\"</p>\n<p>\"Doesn't it?\" said Eeyore. \"It goes in and out like anything.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm very glad,\" said Pooh happily, \"that I thought of giving you a\nUseful Pot to put things in.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm very glad,\" said Piglet happily, \"that I thought of giving you\nSomething to put in a Useful Pot.\"</p>\n<p>But Eeyore wasn't listening. He was taking the balloon out, and putting\nit back again, as happy as could be....</p>\n<p>\"And didn'tIgive him anything?\" asked Christopher Robin sadly.</p>\n<p>\"Of course you did,\" I said. \"You gave him—don't you remember—a\nlittle—a little——\"</p>\n<p>\"I gave him a box of paints to paint things with.\"</p>\n<p>\"That was it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why didn't I give it to him in the morning?\"</p>\n<p>\"You were so busy getting his party ready for him. He had a cake with\nicing on the top, and three candles, and his name in pink sugar,\nand——\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,Iremember,\" said Christopher Robin.</p>"
