  "content": "<p>The Piglet lived in a very grand house in the middle of a beech-tree,\nand the beech-tree was in the middle of the forest, and the Piglet lived\nin the middle of the house. Next to his house was a piece of broken\nboard which had: \"TRESPASSERS W\" on it. When Christopher Robin asked the\nPiglet what it meant, he said it was his grandfather's name, and had\nbeen in the family for a long time, Christopher Robin said youcouldn'tbe called Trespassers W, and Piglet said yes, you could,\nbecause his grandfather was, and it was short for Trespassers Will,\nwhich was short for Trespassers William. And his grandfather had had two\nnames in case he lost one—Trespassers after an uncle, and William after\nTrespassers.</p>\n<p>\"I've got two names,\" said Christopher Robin carelessly.</p>\n<p>\"Well, there you are, that proves it,\" said Piglet.</p>\n<p>One fine winter's day when Piglet was brushing away the snow in front of\nhis house, he happened to look up, and there was Winnie-the-Pooh. Pooh\nwas walking round and round in a circle, thinking of something else, and\nwhen Piglet called to him, he just went on walking.</p>\n<p>\"Hallo!\" said Piglet, \"what areyoudoing?\"</p>\n<p>\"Hunting,\" said Pooh.</p>\n<p>\"Hunting what?\"</p>\n<p>\"Tracking something,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh very mysteriously.</p>\n<p>\"Tracking what?\" said Piglet, coming closer.</p>\n<p>\"That's just what I ask myself. I ask myself, What?\"</p>\n<p>\"What do you think you'll answer?\"</p>\n<p>\"I shall have to wait until I catch up with it,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.\n\"Now, look there.\" He pointed to the ground in front of him. \"What do\nyou see there?\"</p>\n<p>\"Tracks,\" said Piglet. \"Paw-marks.\" He gave a little squeak of\nexcitement. \"Oh, Pooh! Do you think it's a—a—a Woozle?\"</p>\n<p>\"It may be,\" said Pooh. \"Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't. You\nnever can tell with paw-marks.\"</p>\n<p>With these few words he went on tracking, and Piglet, after watching him\nfor a minute or two, ran after him. Winnie-the-Pooh had come to a sudden\nstop, and was bending over the tracks in a puzzled sort of way.</p>\n<p>\"What's the matter?\" asked Piglet.</p>\n<p>\"It's a very funny thing,\" said Bear, \"but there seem to betwoanimals now. This—whatever-it-was—has been joined by\nanother—whatever-it-is—and the two of them are now proceeding in\ncompany. Would you mind coming with me, Piglet, in case they turn out\nto be Hostile Animals?\"</p>\n<p>Piglet scratched his ear in a nice sort of way, and said that he had\nnothing to do until Friday, and would be delighted to come, in case it\nreallywasa Woozle.</p>\n<p>\"You mean, in case it really is two Woozles,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, and\nPiglet said that anyhow he had nothing to do until Friday. So off they\nwent together.</p>\n<p>There was a small spinney of larch trees just here, and it seemed as if\nthe two Woozles, if that is what they were, had been going round this\nspinney; so round this spinney went Pooh and Piglet after them; Piglet\npassing the time by telling Pooh what his Grandfather Trespassers W had\ndone to Remove Stiffness after Tracking, and how his Grandfather\nTrespassers W had suffered in his later years from Shortness of Breath,\nand other matters of interest, and Pooh wondering what a Grandfather was\nlike, and if perhaps this was Two Grandfathers they were after now, and,\nif so, whether he would be allowed to take one home and keep it, and\nwhat Christopher Robin would say. And still the tracks went on in front\nof them....</p>\n<p>Suddenly Winnie-the-Pooh stopped, and pointed excitedly in front of him.\n\"Look!\"</p>\n<p>\"What?\" said Piglet, with a jump. And then, to show that he hadn't\nbeen frightened, he jumped up and down once or twice more in an\nexercising sort of way.</p>\n<p>\"The tracks!\" said Pooh. \"A third animal has joined the other two!\"</p>\n<p>\"Pooh!\" cried Piglet. \"Do you think it is another Woozle?\"</p>\n<p>\"No,\" said Pooh, \"because it makes different marks. It is either Two\nWoozles and one, as it might be, Wizzle, or Two, as it might be, Wizzles\nand one, if so it is, Woozle. Let us continue to follow them.\"</p>\n<p>So they went on, feeling just a little anxious now, in case the three\nanimals in front of them were of Hostile Intent. And Piglet wished very\nmuch that his Grandfather T. W. were there, instead of elsewhere, and\nPooh thought how nice it would be if they met Christopher Robin suddenly\nbut quite accidentally, and only because he liked Christopher Robin so\nmuch. And then, all of a sudden, Winnie-the-Pooh stopped again, and\nlicked the tip of his nose in a cooling manner, for he was feeling more\nhot and anxious than ever in his life before.There were four animals\nin front of them!</p>\n<p>\"Do you see, Piglet? Look at their tracks! Three, as it were, Woozles,\nand one, as it was, Wizzle.Another Woozle has joined them!\"</p>\n<p>And so it seemed to be. There were the tracks; crossing over each other\nhere, getting muddled up with each other there; but, quite plainly every\nnow and then, the tracks of four sets of paws.</p>\n<p>\"Ithink,\" said Piglet, when he had licked the tip of his nose too,\nand found that it brought very little comfort, \"Ithinkthat I have\njust remembered something. I have just remembered something that I\nforgot to do yesterday and shan't be able to do to-morrow. So I suppose\nI really ought to go back and do it now.\"</p>\n<p>\"We'll do it this afternoon, and I'll come with you,\" said Pooh.</p>\n<p>\"It isn't the sort of thing you can do in the afternoon,\" said Piglet\nquickly. \"It's a very particular morning thing, that has to be done in\nthe morning, and, if possible, between the hours of——What would you\nsay the time was?\"</p>\n<p>\"About twelve,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, looking at the sun.</p>\n<p>\"Between, as I was saying, the hours of twelve and twelve five. So,\nreally, dear old Pooh, if you'll excuse me——What's that?\"</p>\n<p>Pooh looked up at the sky, and then, as he heard the whistle again, he\nlooked up into the branches of a big oak-tree, and then he saw a friend\nof his.</p>\n<p>\"It's Christopher Robin,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, then you'll be all right,\" said Piglet. \"You'll be quite safe withhim. Good-bye,\" and he trotted off home as quickly as he could, very\nglad to be Out of All Danger again.</p>\n<p>Christopher Robin came slowly down his tree.</p>\n<p>\"Silly old Bear,\" he said, \"whatwereyou doing? First you went round\nthe spinney twice by yourself, and then Piglet ran after you and you\nwent round again together, and then you were just going round a fourth\ntime——\"</p>\n<p>\"Wait a moment,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, holding up his paw.</p>\n<p>He sat down and thought, in the most thoughtful way he could think. Then\nhe fitted his paw into one of the Tracks ... and then he scratched his\nnose twice, and stood up.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.</p>\n<p>\"I see now,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.</p>\n<p>\"I have been Foolish and Deluded,\" said he, \"and I am a Bear of No Brain\nat All.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're the Best Bear in All the World,\" said Christopher Robin\nsoothingly.</p>\n<p>\"Am I?\" said Pooh hopefully. And then he brightened up suddenly.</p>\n<p>\"Anyhow,\" he said, \"it is nearly Luncheon Time.\"</p>\n<p>So he went home for it.</p>"
