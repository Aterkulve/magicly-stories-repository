  "content": "<p>Feeling that Peter was on his way back, the Neverland had again woke into life.\nWe ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened, but woke is better and was\nalways used by Peter.</p>\n<p>In his absence things are usually quiet on the island. The fairies take an hour\nlonger in the morning, the beasts attend to their young, the redskins feed\nheavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and lost boys meet they\nmerely bite their thumbs at each other. But with the coming of Peter, who hates\nlethargy, they are under way again: if you put your ear to the ground now, you\nwould hear the whole island seething with life.</p>\n<p>On this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as follows. The\nlost boys were out looking for Peter, the pirates were out looking for the lost\nboys, the redskins were out looking for the pirates, and the beasts were out\nlooking for the redskins. They were going round and round the island, but they\ndid not meet because all were going at the same rate.</p>\n<p>All wanted blood except the boys, who liked it as a rule, but to-night were out\nto greet their captain. The boys on the island vary, of course, in numbers,\naccording as they get killed and so on; and when they seem to be growing up,\nwhich is against the rules, Peter thins them out; but at this time there were\nsix of them, counting the twins as two. Let us pretend to lie here among the\nsugar-cane and watch them as they steal by in single file, each with his hand\non his dagger.</p>\n<p>They are forbidden by Peter to look in the least like him, and they wear the\nskins of the bears slain by themselves, in which they are so round and furry\nthat when they fall they roll. They have therefore become very sure-footed.</p>\n<p>The first to pass is Tootles, not the least brave but the most unfortunate of\nall that gallant band. He had been in fewer adventures than any of them,\nbecause the big things constantly happened just when he had stepped round the\ncorner; all would be quiet, he would take the opportunity of going off to\ngather a few sticks for firewood, and then when he returned the others would be\nsweeping up the blood. This ill-luck had given a gentle melancholy to his\ncountenance, but instead of souring his nature had sweetened it, so that he was\nquite the humblest of the boys. Poor kind Tootles, there is danger in the air\nfor you to-night. Take care lest an adventure is now offered you, which, if\naccepted, will plunge you in deepest woe. Tootles, the fairy Tink, who is bent\non mischief this night is looking for a tool, and she thinks you are the most\neasily tricked of the boys. ’Ware Tinker Bell.</p>\n<p>Would that he could hear us, but we are not really on the island, and he passes\nby, biting his knuckles.</p>\n<p>Next comes Nibs, the gay and debonair, followed by Slightly, who cuts whistles\nout of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own tunes. Slightly is the most\nconceited of the boys. He thinks he remembers the days before he was lost, with\ntheir manners and customs, and this has given his nose an offensive tilt. Curly\nis fourth; he is a pickle, and so often has he had to deliver up his person\nwhen Peter said sternly, “Stand forth the one who did this thing,”\nthat now at the command he stands forth automatically whether he has done it or\nnot. Last come the Twins, who cannot be described because we should be sure to\nbe describing the wrong one. Peter never quite knew what twins were, and his\nband were not allowed to know anything he did not know, so these two were\nalways vague about themselves, and did their best to give satisfaction by\nkeeping close together in an apologetic sort of way.</p>\n<p>The boys vanish in the gloom, and after a pause, but not a long pause, for\nthings go briskly on the island, come the pirates on their track. We hear them\nbefore they are seen, and it is always the same dreadful song:</p>\n<p>“Avast belay, yo ho, heave to,A-pirating we go,And if we’re parted by a shotWe’re sure to meet below!”</p>\n<p>A more villainous-looking lot never hung in a row on Execution dock. Here, a\nlittle in advance, ever and again with his head to the ground listening, his\ngreat arms bare, pieces of eight in his ears as ornaments, is the handsome\nItalian Cecco, who cut his name in letters of blood on the back of the governor\nof the prison at Gao. That gigantic black behind him has had many names since\nhe dropped the one with which dusky mothers still terrify their children on the\nbanks of the Guadjo-mo. Here is Bill Jukes, every inch of him tattooed, the\nsame Bill Jukes who got six dozen on theWalrusfrom Flint before he\nwould drop the bag of moidores; and Cookson, said to be Black Murphy’s\nbrother (but this was never proved), and Gentleman Starkey, once an usher in a\npublic school and still dainty in his ways of killing; and Skylights\n(Morgan’s Skylights); and the Irish bo’sun Smee, an oddly genial\nman who stabbed, so to speak, without offence, and was the only Non-conformist\nin Hook’s crew; and Noodler, whose hands were fixed on backwards; and\nRobt. Mullins and Alf Mason and many another ruffian long known and feared on\nthe Spanish Main.</p>\n<p>In the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark setting, reclined\nJames Hook, or as he wrote himself, Jas. Hook, of whom it is said he was the\nonly man that the Sea-Cook feared. He lay at his ease in a rough chariot drawn\nand propelled by his men, and instead of a right hand he had the iron hook with\nwhich ever and anon he encouraged them to increase their pace. As dogs this\nterrible man treated and addressed them, and as dogs they obeyed him. In person\nhe was cadaverous and blackavized, and his hair was dressed in long curls,\nwhich at a little distance looked like black candles, and gave a singularly\nthreatening expression to his handsome countenance. His eyes were of the blue\nof the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy, save when he was plunging\nhis hook into you, at which time two red spots appeared in them and lit them up\nhorribly. In manner, something of the grand seigneur still clung to him, so\nthat he even ripped you up with an air, and I have been told that he was araconteurof repute. He was never more sinister than when he was most\npolite, which is probably the truest test of breeding; and the elegance of his\ndiction, even when he was swearing, no less than the distinction of his\ndemeanour, showed him one of a different cast from his crew. A man of\nindomitable courage, it was said that the only thing he shied at was the sight\nof his own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour. In dress he\nsomewhat aped the attire associated with the name of Charles II, having heard\nit said in some earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblance\nto the ill-fated Stuarts; and in his mouth he had a holder of his own\ncontrivance which enabled him to smoke two cigars at once. But undoubtedly the\ngrimmest part of him was his iron claw.</p>\n<p>Let us now kill a pirate, to show Hook’s method. Skylights will do. As\nthey pass, Skylights lurches clumsily against him, ruffling his lace collar;\nthe hook shoots forth, there is a tearing sound and one screech, then the body\nis kicked aside, and the pirates pass on. He has not even taken the cigars from\nhis mouth.</p>\n<p>Such is the terrible man against whom Peter Pan is pitted. Which will win?</p>\n<p>On the trail of the pirates, stealing noiselessly down the war-path, which is\nnot visible to inexperienced eyes, come the redskins, every one of them with\nhis eyes peeled. They carry tomahawks and knives, and their naked bodies gleam\nwith paint and oil. Strung around them are scalps, of boys as well as of\npirates, for these are the Piccaninny tribe, and not to be confused with the\nsofter-hearted Delawares or the Hurons. In the van, on all fours, is Great Big\nLittle Panther, a brave of so many scalps that in his present position they\nsomewhat impede his progress. Bringing up the rear, the place of greatest\ndanger, comes Tiger Lily, proudly erect, a princess in her own right. She is\nthe most beautiful of dusky Dianas and the belle of the Piccaninnies,\ncoquettish, cold and amorous by turns; there is not a brave who would not have\nthe wayward thing to wife, but she staves off the altar with a hatchet. Observe\nhow they pass over fallen twigs without making the slightest noise. The only\nsound to be heard is their somewhat heavy breathing. The fact is that they are\nall a little fat just now after the heavy gorging, but in time they will work\nthis off. For the moment, however, it constitutes their chief danger.</p>\n<p>The redskins disappear as they have come like shadows, and soon their place is\ntaken by the beasts, a great and motley procession: lions, tigers, bears, and\nthe innumerable smaller savage things that flee from them, for every kind of\nbeast, and, more particularly, all the man-eaters, live cheek by jowl on the\nfavoured island. Their tongues are hanging out, they are hungry to-night.</p>\n<p>When they have passed, comes the last figure of all, a gigantic crocodile. We\nshall see for whom she is looking presently.</p>\n<p>The crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again, for the procession must\ncontinue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or changes its pace. Then\nquickly they will be on top of each other.</p>\n<p>All are keeping a sharp look-out in front, but none suspects that the danger\nmay be creeping up from behind. This shows how real the island was.</p>\n<p>The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys. They flung themselves\ndown on the sward, close to their underground home.</p>\n<p>“I do wish Peter would come back,” every one of them said\nnervously, though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than\ntheir captain.</p>\n<p>“I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates,” Slightly\nsaid, in the tone that prevented his being a general favourite; but perhaps\nsome distant sound disturbed him, for he added hastily, “but I wish he\nwould come back, and tell us whether he has heard anything more about\nCinderella.”</p>\n<p>They talked of Cinderella, and Tootles was confident that his mother must have\nbeen very like her.</p>\n<p>It was only in Peter’s absence that they could speak of mothers, the\nsubject being forbidden by him as silly.</p>\n<p>“All I remember about my mother,” Nibs told them, “is that\nshe often said to my father, ‘Oh, how I wish I had a cheque-book of my\nown!’ I don’t know what a cheque-book is, but I should just love to\ngive my mother one.”</p>\n<p>While they talked they heard a distant sound. You or I, not being wild things\nof the woods, would have heard nothing, but they heard it, and it was the grim\nsong:</p>\n<p>“Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate life,The flag o’ skull and bones,A merry hour, a hempen rope,And hey for Davy Jones.”</p>\n<p>At once the lost boys—but where are they? They are no longer there.\nRabbits could not have disappeared more quickly.</p>\n<p>I will tell you where they are. With the exception of Nibs, who has darted away\nto reconnoitre, they are already in their home under the ground, a very\ndelightful residence of which we shall see a good deal presently. But how have\nthey reached it? for there is no entrance to be seen, not so much as a large\nstone, which if rolled away, would disclose the mouth of a cave. Look closely,\nhowever, and you may note that there are here seven large trees, each with a\nhole in its hollow trunk as large as a boy. These are the seven entrances to\nthe home under the ground, for which Hook has been searching in vain these many\nmoons. Will he find it tonight?</p>\n<p>As the pirates advanced, the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs disappearing\nthrough the wood, and at once his pistol flashed out. But an iron claw gripped\nhis shoulder.</p>\n<p>“Captain, let go!” he cried, writhing.</p>\n<p>Now for the first time we hear the voice of Hook. It was a black voice.\n“Put back that pistol first,” it said threateningly.</p>\n<p>“It was one of those boys you hate. I could have shot him dead.”</p>\n<p>“Ay, and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily’s redskins upon\nus. Do you want to lose your scalp?”</p>\n<p>“Shall I after him, Captain,” asked pathetic Smee, “and\ntickle him with Johnny Corkscrew?” Smee had pleasant names for\neverything, and his cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew, because he wiggled it in the\nwound. One could mention many lovable traits in Smee. For instance, after\nkilling, it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon.</p>\n<p>“Johnny’s a silent fellow,” he reminded Hook.</p>\n<p>“Not now, Smee,” Hook said darkly. “He is only one, and I\nwant to mischief all the seven. Scatter and look for them.”</p>\n<p>The pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment their Captain and Smee\nwere alone. Hook heaved a heavy sigh, and I know not why it was, perhaps it was\nbecause of the soft beauty of the evening, but there came over him a desire to\nconfide to his faithful bo’sun the story of his life. He spoke long and\nearnestly, but what it was all about Smee, who was rather stupid, did not know\nin the least.</p>\n<p>Anon he caught the word Peter.</p>\n<p>“Most of all,” Hook was saying passionately, “I want their\ncaptain, Peter Pan. ’Twas he cut off my arm.” He brandished the\nhook threateningly. “I’ve waited long to shake his hand with this.\nOh, I’ll tear him!”</p>\n<p>“And yet,” said Smee, “I have often heard you say that hook\nwas worth a score of hands, for combing the hair and other homely uses.”</p>\n<p>“Ay,” the captain answered, “if I was a mother I would pray\nto have my children born with this instead of that,” and he cast a look\nof pride upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other. Then again he\nfrowned.</p>\n<p>“Peter flung my arm,” he said, wincing, “to a crocodile that\nhappened to be passing by.”</p>\n<p>“I have often,” said Smee, “noticed your strange dread of\ncrocodiles.”</p>\n<p>“Not of crocodiles,” Hook corrected him, “but of that one\ncrocodile.” He lowered his voice. “It liked my arm so much, Smee,\nthat it has followed me ever since, from sea to sea and from land to land,\nlicking its lips for the rest of me.”</p>\n<p>“In a way,” said Smee, “it’s sort of a\ncompliment.”</p>\n<p>“I want no such compliments,” Hook barked petulantly. “I want\nPeter Pan, who first gave the brute its taste for me.”</p>\n<p>He sat down on a large mushroom, and now there was a quiver in his voice.\n“Smee,” he said huskily, “that crocodile would have had me\nbefore this, but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick\ninside it, and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and bolt.” He\nlaughed, but in a hollow way.</p>\n<p>“Some day,” said Smee, “the clock will run down, and then\nhe’ll get you.”</p>\n<p>Hook wetted his dry lips. “Ay,” he said, “that’s the\nfear that haunts me.”</p>\n<p>Since sitting down he had felt curiously warm. “Smee,” he said,\n“this seat is hot.” He jumped up. “Odds bobs, hammer and\ntongs I’m burning.”</p>\n<p>They examined the mushroom, which was of a size and solidity unknown on the\nmainland; they tried to pull it up, and it came away at once in their hands,\nfor it had no root. Stranger still, smoke began at once to ascend. The pirates\nlooked at each other. “A chimney!” they both exclaimed.</p>\n<p>They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground. It was the\ncustom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were in the\nneighbourhood.</p>\n<p>Not only smoke came out of it. There came also children’s voices, for so\nsafe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily chattering.\nThe pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the mushroom. They looked around\nthem and noted the holes in the seven trees.</p>\n<p>“Did you hear them say Peter Pan’s from home?” Smee\nwhispered, fidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew.</p>\n<p>Hook nodded. He stood for a long time lost in thought, and at last a curdling\nsmile lit up his swarthy face. Smee had been waiting for it. “Unrip your\nplan, captain,” he cried eagerly.</p>\n<p>“To return to the ship,” Hook replied slowly through his teeth,\n“and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it.\nThere can be but one room below, for there is but one chimney. The silly moles\nhad not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece. That shows they\nhave no mother. We will leave the cake on the shore of the Mermaids’\nLagoon. These boys are always swimming about there, playing with the mermaids.\nThey will find the cake and they will gobble it up, because, having no mother,\nthey don’t know how dangerous ’tis to eat rich damp cake.” He\nburst into laughter, not hollow laughter now, but honest laughter. “Aha,\nthey will die.”</p>\n<p>Smee had listened with growing admiration.</p>\n<p>“It’s the wickedest, prettiest policy ever I heard of!” he\ncried, and in their exultation they danced and sang:</p>\n<p>“Avast, belay, when I appear,By fear they’re overtook;Nought’s left upon your bones when youHave shaken claws with Hook.”</p>\n<p>They began the verse, but they never finished it, for another sound broke in\nand stilled them. There was at first such a tiny sound that a leaf might have\nfallen on it and smothered it, but as it came nearer it was more distinct.</p>\n<p>Tick tick tick tick!</p>\n<p>Hook stood shuddering, one foot in the air.</p>\n<p>“The crocodile!” he gasped, and bounded away, followed by his\nbo’sun.</p>\n<p>It was indeed the crocodile. It had passed the redskins, who were now on the\ntrail of the other pirates. It oozed on after Hook.</p>\n<p>Once more the boys emerged into the open; but the dangers of the night were not\nyet over, for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their midst, pursued by a\npack of wolves. The tongues of the pursuers were hanging out; the baying of\nthem was horrible.</p>\n<p>“Save me, save me!” cried Nibs, falling on the ground.</p>\n<p>“But what can we do, what can we do?”</p>\n<p>It was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their thoughts\nturned to him.</p>\n<p>“What would Peter do?” they cried simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Almost in the same breath they cried, “Peter would look at them through\nhis legs.”</p>\n<p>And then, “Let us do what Peter would do.”</p>\n<p>It is quite the most successful way of defying wolves, and as one boy they bent\nand looked through their legs. The next moment is the long one, but victory\ncame quickly, for as the boys advanced upon them in the terrible attitude, the\nwolves dropped their tails and fled.</p>\n<p>Now Nibs rose from the ground, and the others thought that his staring eyes\nstill saw the wolves. But it was not wolves he saw.</p>\n<p>“I have seen a wonderfuller thing,” he cried, as they gathered\nround him eagerly. “A great white bird. It is flying this way.”</p>\n<p>“What kind of a bird, do you think?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know,” Nibs said, awestruck, “but it looks so\nweary, and as it flies it moans, ‘Poor Wendy.’”</p>\n<p>“Poor Wendy?”</p>\n<p>“I remember,” said Slightly instantly, “there are birds\ncalled Wendies.”</p>\n<p>“See, it comes!” cried Curly, pointing to Wendy in the heavens.</p>\n<p>Wendy was now almost overhead, and they could hear her plaintive cry. But more\ndistinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell. The jealous fairy had now cast\noff all disguise of friendship, and was darting at her victim from every\ndirection, pinching savagely each time she touched.</p>\n<p>“Hullo, Tink,” cried the wondering boys.</p>\n<p>Tink’s reply rang out: “Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy.”</p>\n<p>It was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered. “Let us do\nwhat Peter wishes!” cried the simple boys. “Quick, bows and\narrows!”</p>\n<p>All but Tootles popped down their trees. He had a bow and arrow with him, and\nTink noted it, and rubbed her little hands.</p>\n<p>“Quick, Tootles, quick,” she screamed. “Peter will be so\npleased.”</p>\n<p>Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow. “Out of the way,\nTink,” he shouted, and then he fired, and Wendy fluttered to the ground\nwith an arrow in her breast.</p>"
