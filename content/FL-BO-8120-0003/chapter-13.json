Mahadeo!  He made all,—<br/>\n    Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,<br/>\n    And mother’s heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!</i><br/>\n<br/>\nWheat he gave to rich folk, millet to the poor,<br/>\nBroken scraps for holy men that beg from door to door;<br/>\nBattle to the tiger, carrion to the kite,<br/>\nAnd rags and bones to wicked wolves without the wall at night.<br/>\nNaught he found too lofty, none he saw too low—<br/>\nParbati beside him watched them come and go;<br/>\nThought to cheat her husband, turning Shiv to jest—<br/>\nStole the little grasshopper and hid it in her breast.<br/>\n    <i>So she tricked him, Shiva the Preserver.<br/>\n    Mahadeo!  Mahadeo!  Turn and see.<br/>\n    Tall are the camels, heavy are the kine,<br/>\n    But this was Least of Little Things, O little son of mine!</i><br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the dole was ended, laughingly she said,<br/>\n“Master, of a million mouths, is not one unfed?”<br/>\nLaughing, Shiv made answer, “All have had their part,<br/>\nEven he, the little one, hidden ’neath thy heart.”<br/>\nFrom her breast she plucked it, Parbati the thief,<br/>\nSaw the Least of Little Things gnawed a new-grown leaf!<br/>\nSaw and feared and wondered, making prayer to Shiv,<br/>\nWho hath surely given meat to all that live.<br/>\n    <i>All things made he—Shiva the Preserver.<br/>\n    Mahadeo!  Mahadeo!  He made all,—<br/>\n    Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,<br/>\n    And mother’s heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!</i>\n</p><div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%;\">\n<img alt=\"{0285}\" src=\"images/{0285}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n</div><img alt=\"{0285}\" src=\"images/{0285}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>"
