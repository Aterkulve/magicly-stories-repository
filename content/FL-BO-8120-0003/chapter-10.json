The hooded Death has missed!<br/>\n    (<i>Woe betide thee, Nag!</i>)\n</p><p>\nThis is the story of the great war that Rikki-tikki-tavi fought single-handed,\nthrough the bath-rooms of the big bungalow in Segowlee cantonment. Darzee, the\nTailorbird, helped him, and Chuchundra, the muskrat, who never comes out into\nthe middle of the floor, but always creeps round by the wall, gave him advice,\nbut Rikki-tikki did the real fighting.\n</p><p>\nHe was a mongoose, rather like a little cat in his fur and his tail, but quite\nlike a weasel in his head and his habits. His eyes and the end of his restless\nnose were pink. He could scratch himself anywhere he pleased with any leg,\nfront or back, that he chose to use. He could fluff up his tail till it looked\nlike a bottle brush, and his war cry as he scuttled through the long grass was:\n“Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!”\n</p><p>\nOne day, a high summer flood washed him out of the burrow where he lived with\nhis father and mother, and carried him, kicking and clucking, down a roadside\nditch. He found a little wisp of grass floating there, and clung to it till he\nlost his senses. When he revived, he was lying in the hot sun on the middle of\na garden path, very draggled indeed, and a small boy was saying, “Here’s a dead\nmongoose. Let’s have a funeral.”\n</p><p>\n“No,” said his mother, “let’s take him in and dry him. Perhaps he isn’t really\ndead.”\n</p><p>\nThey took him into the house, and a big man picked him up between his finger\nand thumb and said he was not dead but half choked. So they wrapped him in\ncotton wool, and warmed him over a little fire, and he opened his eyes and\nsneezed.\n</p><p>\n“Now,” said the big man (he was an Englishman who had just moved into the\nbungalow), “don’t frighten him, and we’ll see what he’ll do.”\n</p><p>\nIt is the hardest thing in the world to frighten a mongoose, because he is\neaten up from nose to tail with curiosity. The motto of all the mongoose family\nis “Run and find out,” and Rikki-tikki was a true mongoose. He looked at the\ncotton wool, decided that it was not good to eat, ran all round the table, sat\nup and put his fur in order, scratched himself, and jumped on the small boy’s\nshoulder.\n</p><div class=\"figright\" style=\"width:20%;\">\n<img alt=\"{8197} \" src=\"images/{8197}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">Rikki-tikki looked down between the boy’s collar and neck</p>\n</div><img alt=\"{8197} \" src=\"images/{8197}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/><p class=\"caption\">Rikki-tikki looked down between the boy’s collar and neck</p><p>\n“Don’t be frightened, Teddy,” said his father. “That’s his way of making\nfriends.”\n</p><p>\n“Ouch! He’s tickling under my chin,” said Teddy.\n</p><p>\nRikki-tikki looked down between the boy’s collar and neck, snuffed at his ear,\nand climbed down to the floor, where he sat rubbing his nose.\n</p><p>\n“Good gracious,” said Teddy’s mother, “and that’s a wild creature! I suppose\nhe’s so tame because we’ve been kind to him.”\n</p><p>\n“All mongooses are like that,” said her husband. “If Teddy doesn’t pick him up\nby the tail, or try to put him in a cage, he’ll run in and out of the house all\nday long. Let’s give him something to eat.”\n</p><p>\nThey gave him a little piece of raw meat. Rikki-tikki liked it immensely, and\nwhen it was finished he went out into the veranda and sat in the sunshine and\nfluffed up his fur to make it dry to the roots. Then he felt better.\n</p><div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%;\">\n<img alt=\"{0198}\" src=\"images/{0198}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">He put his nose into the ink</p>\n</div><img alt=\"{0198}\" src=\"images/{0198}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/><p class=\"caption\">He put his nose into the ink</p><p>\n“There are more things to find out about in this house,” he said to himself,\n“than all my family could find out in all their lives. I shall certainly stay\nand find out.”\n</p><p>\nHe spent all that day roaming over the house. He nearly drowned himself in the\nbath-tubs, put his nose into the ink on a writing table, and burned it on the\nend of the big man’s cigar, for he climbed up in the big man’s lap to see how\nwriting was done. At nightfall he ran into Teddy’s nursery to watch how\nkerosene lamps were lighted, and when Teddy went to bed Rikki-tikki climbed up\ntoo. But he was a restless companion, because he had to get up and attend to\nevery noise all through the night, and find out what made it. Teddy’s mother\nand father came in, the last thing, to look at their boy, and Rikki-tikki was\nawake on the pillow. “I don’t like that,” said Teddy’s mother. “He may bite the\nchild.” “He’ll do no such thing,” said the father. “Teddy’s safer with that\nlittle beast than if he had a bloodhound to watch him. If a snake came into the\nnursery now—”\n</p><div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%;\">\n<img alt=\"{0199}\" src=\"images/{0199}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">Rikki-tikki was awake on the pillow.</p>\n</div><img alt=\"{0199}\" src=\"images/{0199}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/><p class=\"caption\">Rikki-tikki was awake on the pillow.</p><p>\nBut Teddy’s mother wouldn’t think of anything so awful.\n</p><p>\nEarly in the morning Rikki-tikki came to early breakfast in the veranda riding\non Teddy’s shoulder, and they gave him banana and some boiled egg. He sat on\nall their laps one after the other, because every well-brought-up mongoose\nalways hopes to be a house mongoose some day and have rooms to run about in;\nand Rikki-tikki’s mother (she used to live in the general’s house at Segowlee)\nhad carefully told Rikki what to do if ever he came across white men.\n</p><div class=\"figleft\" style=\"width:20%;\">\n<img alt=\"{9200}\" src=\"images/{9200}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">He came to breakfast riding on Teddy’s shoulder.</p>\n</div><img alt=\"{9200}\" src=\"images/{9200}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/><p class=\"caption\">He came to breakfast riding on Teddy’s shoulder.</p><p>\nThen Rikki-tikki went out into the garden to see what was to be seen. It was a\nlarge garden, only half cultivated, with bushes, as big as summer-houses, of\nMarshal Niel roses, lime and orange trees, clumps of bamboos, and thickets of\nhigh grass. Rikki-tikki licked his lips. “This is a splendid hunting-ground,”\nhe said, and his tail grew bottle-brushy at the thought of it, and he scuttled\nup and down the garden, snuffing here and there till he heard very sorrowful\nvoices in a thorn-bush.\n</p><p>\nIt was Darzee, the Tailor-bird, and his wife. They had made a beautiful nest by\npulling two big leaves together and stitching them up the edges with fibers,\nand had filled the hollow with cotton and downy fluff. The nest swayed to and\nfro, as they sat on the rim and cried.\n</p><div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%;\">\n<img alt=\"{0201}\" src=\"images/{0201}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">“We are very miserable,” said Darzee.</p>\n</div><img alt=\"{0201}\" src=\"images/{0201}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/><p class=\"caption\">“We are very miserable,” said Darzee.</p><p>\n“What is the matter?” asked Rikki-tikki.\n</p><p>\n“We are very miserable,” said Darzee. “One of our babies fell out of the nest\nyesterday and Nag ate him.”\n</p><p>\n“H’m!” said Rikki-tikki, “that is very sad—but I am a stranger here. Who is\nNag?”\n</p><p>\nDarzee and his wife only cowered down in the nest without answering, for from\nthe thick grass at the foot of the bush there came a low hiss—a horrid cold\nsound that made Rikki-tikki jump back two clear feet. Then inch by inch out of\nthe grass rose up the head and spread hood of Nag, the big black cobra, and he\nwas five feet long from tongue to tail. When he had lifted one-third of himself\nclear of the ground, he stayed balancing to and fro exactly as a dandelion tuft\nbalances in the wind, and he looked at Rikki-tikki with the wicked snake’s eyes\nthat never change their expression, whatever the snake may be thinking of.\n</p><p>\n“Who is Nag?” said he. “I am Nag. The great God Brahm put his mark upon all our\npeople, when the first cobra spread his hood to keep the sun off Brahm as he\nslept. Look, and be afraid!”\n</p><div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:70%;\">\n<img alt=\"{0203}\" src=\"images/{0203}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">“I am Nag,” said the cobra: “Look, and be afraid!”\nBut at the bottom of his cold heart, he was afraid.</p>\n</div><img alt=\"{0203}\" src=\"images/{0203}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/><p class=\"caption\">“I am Nag,” said the cobra: “Look, and be afraid!”\nBut at the bottom of his cold heart, he was afraid.</p><p>\nHe spread out his hood more than ever, and Rikki-tikki saw the spectacle-mark\non the back of it that looks exactly like the eye part of a hook-and-eye\nfastening. He was afraid for the minute, but it is impossible for a mongoose to\nstay frightened for any length of time, and though Rikki-tikki had never met a\nlive cobra before, his mother had fed him on dead ones, and he knew that all a\ngrown mongoose’s business in life was to fight and eat snakes. Nag knew that\ntoo and, at the bottom of his cold heart, he was afraid.\n</p><div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:70%;\">\n<img alt=\"{5250}\" src=\"images/{5250}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and Nag</p>\n</div><img alt=\"{5250}\" src=\"images/{5250}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/><p class=\"caption\">Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and Nag</p><p>\n“Well,” said Rikki-tikki, and his tail began to fluff up again, “marks or no\nmarks, do you think it is right for you to eat fledglings out of a nest?”\n</p><p>\nNag was thinking to himself, and watching the least little movement in the\ngrass behind Rikki-tikki. He knew that mongooses in the garden meant death\nsooner or later for him and his family, but he wanted to get Rikki-tikki off\nhis guard. So he dropped his head a little, and put it on one side.\n</p><p>\n“Let us talk,” he said. “You eat eggs. Why should not I eat birds?”\n</p><p>\n“Behind you! Look behind you!” sang Darzee.\n</p><div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:70%;\">\n<img alt=\"{0207}\" src=\"images/{0207}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">He jumped up in the air, and just under him whizzed by the\nhead of Nagaina.</p>\n</div><img alt=\"{0207}\" src=\"images/{0207}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/><p class=\"caption\">He jumped up in the air, and just under him whizzed by the\nhead of Nagaina.</p><p>\nRikki-tikki knew better than to waste time in staring. He jumped up in the air\nas high as he could go, and just under him whizzed by the head of Nagaina,\nNag’s wicked wife. She had crept up behind him as he was talking, to make an\nend of him. He heard her savage hiss as the stroke missed. He came down almost\nacross her back, and if he had been an old mongoose he would have known that\nthen was the time to break her back with one bite; but he was afraid of the\nterrible lashing return stroke of the cobra. He bit, indeed, but did not bite\nlong enough, and he jumped clear of the whisking tail, leaving Nagaina torn and\nangry.\n</p><p>\n“Wicked, wicked Darzee!” said Nag, lashing up as high as he could reach toward\nthe nest in the thorn-bush. But Darzee had built it out of reach of snakes, and\nit only swayed to and fro.\n</p><p>\nRikki-tikki felt his eyes growing red and hot (when a mongoose’s eyes grow red,\nhe is angry), and he sat back on his tail and hind legs like a little kangaroo,\nand looked all round him, and chattered with rage. But Nag and Nagaina had\ndisappeared into the grass. When a snake misses its stroke, it never says\nanything or gives any sign of what it means to do next. Rikki-tikki did not\ncare to follow them, for he did not feel sure that he could manage two snakes\nat once. So he trotted off to the gravel path near the house, and sat down to\nthink. It was a serious matter for him.\n</p><p>\nIf you read the old books of natural history, you will find they say that when\nthe mongoose fights the snake and happens to get bitten, he runs off and eats\nsome herb that cures him. That is not true. The victory is only a matter of\nquickness of eye and quickness of foot—snake’s blow against mongoose’s jump—and\nas no eye can follow the motion of a snake’s head when it strikes, this makes\nthings much more wonderful than any magic herb. Rikki-tikki knew he was a young\nmongoose, and it made him all the more pleased to think that he had managed to\nescape a blow from behind. It gave him confidence in himself, and when Teddy\ncame running down the path, Rikki-tikki was ready to be petted.\n</p><p>\nBut just as Teddy was stooping, something wriggled a little in the dust, and a\ntiny voice said: “Be careful. I am Death!” It was Karait, the dusty brown\nsnakeling that lies for choice on the dusty earth; and his bite is as dangerous\nas the cobra’s. But he is so small that nobody thinks of him, and so he does\nthe more harm to people.\n</p><p>\nRikki-tikki’s eyes grew red again, and he danced up to Karait with the peculiar\nrocking, swaying motion that he had inherited from his family. It looks very\nfunny, but it is so perfectly balanced a gait that you can fly off from it at\nany angle you please, and in dealing with snakes this is an advantage. If\nRikki-tikki had only known, he was doing a much more dangerous thing than\nfighting Nag, for Karait is so small, and can turn so quickly, that unless\nRikki bit him close to the back of the head, he would get the return stroke in\nhis eye or his lip. But Rikki did not know. His eyes were all red, and he\nrocked back and forth, looking for a good place to hold. Karait struck out.\nRikki jumped sideways and tried to run in, but the wicked little dusty gray\nhead lashed within a fraction of his shoulder, and he had to jump over the\nbody, and the head followed his heels close.\n</p><p>\nTeddy shouted to the house: “Oh, look here! Our mongoose is killing a snake.”\nAnd Rikki-tikki heard a scream from Teddy’s mother. His father ran out with a\nstick, but by the time he came up, Karait had lunged out once too far, and\nRikki-tikki had sprung, jumped on the snake’s back, dropped his head far\nbetween his forelegs, bitten as high up the back as he could get hold, and\nrolled away. That bite paralyzed Karait, and Rikki-tikki was just going to eat\nhim up from the tail, after the custom of his family at dinner, when he\nremembered that a full meal makes a slow mongoose, and if he wanted all his\nstrength and quickness ready, he must keep himself thin.\n</p><p>\nHe went away for a dust bath under the castor-oil bushes, while Teddy’s father\nbeat the dead Karait. “What is the use of that?” thought Rikki-tikki. “I have\nsettled it all;” and then Teddy’s mother picked him up from the dust and hugged\nhim, crying that he had saved Teddy from death, and Teddy’s father said that he\nwas a providence, and Teddy looked on with big scared eyes. Rikki-tikki was\nrather amused at all the fuss, which, of course, he did not understand. Teddy’s\nmother might just as well have petted Teddy for playing in the dust. Rikki was\nthoroughly enjoying himself.\n</p><p>\nThat night at dinner, walking to and fro among the wine-glasses on the table,\nhe might have stuffed himself three times over with nice things. But he\nremembered Nag and Nagaina, and though it was very pleasant to be patted and\npetted by Teddy’s mother, and to sit on Teddy’s shoulder, his eyes would get\nred from time to time, and he would go off into his long war cry of\n“Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!”\n</p><div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:70%;\">\n<img alt=\"{0212}\" src=\"images/{0212}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">In the dark he ran up against Chuchundra, the muskrat.</p>\n</div><img alt=\"{0212}\" src=\"images/{0212}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/><p class=\"caption\">In the dark he ran up against Chuchundra, the muskrat.</p><p>\nTeddy carried him off to bed, and insisted on Rikki-tikki sleeping under his\nchin. Rikki-tikki was too well bred to bite or scratch, but as soon as Teddy\nwas asleep he went off for his nightly walk round the house, and in the dark he\nran up against Chuchundra, the muskrat, creeping around by the wall.\nChuchundra is a broken-hearted little beast. He whimpers and cheeps all the\nnight, trying to make up his mind to run into the middle of the room. But he\nnever gets there.\n</p><p>\n“Don’t kill me,” said Chuchundra, almost weeping. “Rikki-tikki, don’t kill me!”\n</p><p>\n“Do you think a snake-killer kills muskrats?” said Rikki-tikki scornfully.\n</p><p>\n“Those who kill snakes get killed by snakes,” said Chuchundra, more sorrowfully\nthan ever. “And how am I to be sure that Nag won’t mistake me for you some dark\nnight?”\n</p><p>\n“There’s not the least danger,” said Rikki-tikki. “But Nag is in the garden,\nand I know you don’t go there.”\n</p><p>\n“My cousin Chua, the rat, told me—” said Chuchundra, and then he stopped.\n</p><p>\n“Told you what?”\n</p><p>\n“H’sh! Nag is everywhere, Rikki-tikki. You should have talked to Chua in the\ngarden.”\n</p><p>\n“I didn’t—so you must tell me. Quick, Chuchundra, or I’ll bite you!”\n</p><p>\nChuchundra sat down and cried till the tears rolled off his whiskers. “I am a\nvery poor man,” he sobbed. “I never had spirit enough to run out into the\nmiddle of the room. H’sh! I mustn’t tell you anything. Can’t you hear,\nRikki-tikki?”\n</p><p>\nRikki-tikki listened. The house was as still as still, but he thought he could\njust catch the faintest scratch-scratch in the world—a noise as faint as that\nof a wasp walking on a window-pane—the dry scratch of a snake’s scales on\nbrick-work.\n</p><p>\n“That’s Nag or Nagaina,” he said to himself, “and he is crawling into the\nbath-room sluice. You’re right, Chuchundra; I should have talked to Chua.”\n</p><p>\nHe stole off to Teddy’s bath-room, but there was nothing there, and then to\nTeddy’s mother’s bathroom. At the bottom of the smooth plaster wall there was a\nbrick pulled out to make a sluice for the bath water, and as Rikki-tikki stole\nin by the masonry curb where the bath is put, he heard Nag and Nagaina\nwhispering together outside in the moonlight.\n</p><p>\n“When the house is emptied of people,” said Nagaina to her husband, “he will\nhave to go away, and then the garden will be our own again. Go in quietly, and\nremember that the big man who killed Karait is the first one to bite. Then come\nout and tell me, and we will hunt for Rikki-tikki together.”\n</p><p>\n“But are you sure that there is anything to be gained by killing the people?”\nsaid Nag.\n</p><p>\n“Everything. When there were no people in the bungalow, did we have any\nmongoose in the garden? So long as the bungalow is empty, we are king and queen\nof the garden; and remember that as soon as our eggs in the melon bed hatch (as\nthey may tomorrow), our children will need room and quiet.”\n</p><p>\n“I had not thought of that,” said Nag. “I will go, but there is no need that we\nshould hunt for Rikki-tikki afterward. I will kill the big man and his wife,\nand the child if I can, and come away quietly. Then the bungalow will be empty,\nand Rikki-tikki will go.”\n</p><p>\nRikki-tikki tingled all over with rage and hatred at this, and then Nag’s head\ncame through the sluice, and his five feet of cold body followed it. Angry as\nhe was, Rikki-tikki was very frightened as he saw the size of the big cobra.\nNag coiled himself up, raised his head, and looked into the bathroom in the\ndark, and Rikki could see his eyes glitter.\n</p><p>\n“Now, if I kill him here, Nagaina will know; and if I fight him on the open\nfloor, the odds are in his favor. What am I to do?” said Rikki-tikki-tavi.\n</p><p>\nNag waved to and fro, and then Rikki-tikki heard him drinking from the biggest\nwater-jar that was used to fill the bath. “That is good,” said the snake. “Now,\nwhen Karait was killed, the big man had a stick. He may have that stick still,\nbut when he comes in to bathe in the morning he will not have a stick. I shall\nwait here till he comes. Nagaina—do you hear me?—I shall wait here in the cool\ntill daytime.”\n</p><p>\nThere was no answer from outside, so Rikki-tikki knew Nagaina had gone away.\nNag coiled himself down, coil by coil, round the bulge at the bottom of the\nwater jar, and Rikki-tikki stayed still as death. After an hour he began to\nmove, muscle by muscle, toward the jar. Nag was asleep, and Rikki-tikki looked\nat his big back, wondering which would be the best place for a good hold. “If I\ndon’t break his back at the first jump,” said Rikki, “he can still fight. And\nif he fights—O Rikki!” He looked at the thickness of the neck below the hood,\nbut that was too much for him; and a bite near the tail would only make Nag\nsavage.\n</p><p>\n“It must be the head”’ he said at last; “the head above the hood. And, when I\nam once there, I must not let go.”\n</p><div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:70%;\">\n<img alt=\"{0217}\" src=\"images/{0217}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">Then Rikki-tikki was battered to and fro as a rat is shaken\nby a dog.</p>\n</div><img alt=\"{0217}\" src=\"images/{0217}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/><p class=\"caption\">Then Rikki-tikki was battered to and fro as a rat is shaken\nby a dog.</p><p>\nThen he jumped. The head was lying a little clear of the water jar, under the\ncurve of it; and, as his teeth met, Rikki braced his back against the bulge of\nthe red earthenware to hold down the head. This gave him just one second’s\npurchase, and he made the most of it. Then he was battered to and fro as a rat\nis shaken by a dog—to and fro on the floor, up and down, and around in great\ncircles, but his eyes were red and he held on as the body cart-whipped over the\nfloor, upsetting the tin dipper and the soap dish and the flesh brush, and\nbanged against the tin side of the bath. As he held he closed his jaws tighter\nand tighter, for he made sure he would be banged to death, and, for the honor\nof his family, he preferred to be found with his teeth locked. He was dizzy,\naching, and felt shaken to pieces when something went off like a thunderclap\njust behind him. A hot wind knocked him senseless and red fire singed his fur.\nThe big man had been wakened by the noise, and had fired both barrels of a\nshotgun into Nag just behind the hood.\n</p><p>\nRikki-tikki held on with his eyes shut, for now he was quite sure he was dead.\nBut the head did not move, and the big man picked him up and said, “It’s the\nmongoose again, Alice. The little chap has saved our lives now.”\n</p><p>\nThen Teddy’s mother came in with a very white face, and saw what was left of\nNag, and Rikki-tikki dragged himself to Teddy’s bedroom and spent half the rest\nof the night shaking himself tenderly to find out whether he really was broken\ninto forty pieces, as he fancied.\n</p><p>\nWhen morning came he was very stiff, but well pleased with his doings. “Now I\nhave Nagaina to settle with, and she will be worse than five Nags, and there’s\nno knowing when the eggs she spoke of will hatch. Goodness! I must go and see\nDarzee,” he said.\n</p><p>\nWithout waiting for breakfast, Rikki-tikki ran to the thornbush where Darzee\nwas singing a song of triumph at the top of his voice. The news of Nag’s death\nwas all over the garden, for the sweeper had thrown the body on the\nrubbish-heap.\n</p><p>\n“Oh, you stupid tuft of feathers!” said Rikki-tikki angrily. “Is this the time\nto sing?”\n</p><p>\n“Nag is dead—is dead—is dead!” sang Darzee. “The valiant Rikki-tikki caught him\nby the head and held fast. The big man brought the bang-stick, and Nag fell in\ntwo pieces! He will never eat my babies again.”\n</p><p>\n“All that’s true enough. But where’s Nagaina?” said Rikki-tikki, looking\ncarefully round him.\n</p><p>\n“Nagaina came to the bathroom sluice and called for Nag,” Darzee went on, “and\nNag came out on the end of a stick—the sweeper picked him up on the end of a\nstick and threw him upon the rubbish heap. Let us sing about the great, the\nred-eyed Rikki-tikki!” And Darzee filled his throat and sang.\n</p><p>\n“If I could get up to your nest, I’d roll your babies out!” said Rikki-tikki.\n“You don’t know when to do the right thing at the right time. You’re safe\nenough in your nest there, but it’s war for me down here. Stop singing a\nminute, Darzee.”\n</p><p>\n“For the great, the beautiful Rikki-tikki’s sake I will stop,” said Darzee.\n“What is it, O Killer of the terrible Nag?”\n</p><p>\n“Where is Nagaina, for the third time?”\n</p><p>\n“On the rubbish heap by the stables, mourning for Nag. Great is Rikki-tikki\nwith the white teeth.”\n</p><p>\n“Bother my white teeth! Have you ever heard where she keeps her eggs?”\n</p><p>\n“In the melon bed, on the end nearest the wall, where the sun strikes nearly\nall day. She hid them there weeks ago.”\n</p><p>\n“And you never thought it worth while to tell me? The end nearest the wall, you\nsaid?”\n</p><p>\n“Rikki-tikki, you are not going to eat her eggs?”\n</p><div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:70%;\">\n<img alt=\"{0221}\" src=\"images/{0221}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">Darzee’s wife pretends to have a broken wing</p>\n</div><img alt=\"{0221}\" src=\"images/{0221}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/><p class=\"caption\">Darzee’s wife pretends to have a broken wing</p><p>\n“Not eat exactly; no. Darzee, if you have a grain of sense you will fly off to\nthe stables and pretend that your wing is broken, and let Nagaina chase you\naway to this bush. I must get to the melon-bed, and if I went there now she’d\nsee me.”\n</p><p>\nDarzee was a feather-brained little fellow who could never hold more than one\nidea at a time in his head. And just because he knew that Nagaina’s children\nwere born in eggs like his own, he didn’t think at first that it was fair to\nkill them. But his wife was a sensible bird, and she knew that cobra’s eggs\nmeant young cobras later on. So she flew off from the nest, and left Darzee to\nkeep the babies warm, and continue his song about the death of Nag. Darzee was\nvery like a man in some ways.\n</p><p>\nShe fluttered in front of Nagaina by the rubbish heap and cried out, “Oh, my\nwing is broken! The boy in the house threw a stone at me and broke it.” Then\nshe fluttered more desperately than ever.\n</p><p>\nNagaina lifted up her head and hissed, “You warned Rikki-tikki when I would\nhave killed him. Indeed and truly, you’ve chosen a bad place to be lame in.”\nAnd she moved toward Darzee’s wife, slipping along over the dust.\n</p><p>\n“The boy broke it with a stone!” shrieked Darzee’s wife.\n</p><p>\n“Well! It may be some consolation to you when you’re dead to know that I shall\nsettle accounts with the boy. My husband lies on the rubbish heap this morning,\nbut before night the boy in the house will lie very still. What is the use of\nrunning away? I am sure to catch you. Little fool, look at me!”\n</p><p>\nDarzee’s wife knew better than to do that, for a bird who looks at a snake’s\neyes gets so frightened that she cannot move. Darzee’s wife fluttered on,\npiping sorrowfully, and never leaving the ground, and Nagaina quickened her\npace.\n</p><p>\nRikki-tikki heard them going up the path from the stables, and he raced for the\nend of the melon patch near the wall. There, in the warm litter above the\nmelons, very cunningly hidden, he found twenty-five eggs, about the size of a\nbantam’s eggs, but with whitish skin instead of shell.\n</p><p>\n“I was not a day too soon,” he said, for he could see the baby cobras curled up\ninside the skin, and he knew that the minute they were hatched they could each\nkill a man or a mongoose. He bit off the tops of the eggs as fast as he could,\ntaking care to crush the young cobras, and turned over the litter from time to\ntime to see whether he had missed any. At last there were only three eggs left,\nand Rikki-tikki began to chuckle to himself, when he heard Darzee’s wife\nscreaming:\n</p><p>\n“Rikki-tikki, I led Nagaina toward the house, and she has gone into the\nveranda, and—oh, come quickly—she means killing!”\n</p><p>\nRikki-tikki smashed two eggs, and tumbled backward down the melon-bed with the\nthird egg in his mouth, and scuttled to the veranda as hard as he could put\nfoot to the ground. Teddy and his mother and father were there at early\nbreakfast, but Rikki-tikki saw that they were not eating anything. They sat\nstone-still, and their faces were white. Nagaina was coiled up on the matting\nby Teddy’s chair, within easy striking distance of Teddy’s bare leg, and she\nwas swaying to and fro, singing a song of triumph.\n</p><p>\n“Son of the big man that killed Nag,” she hissed, “stay still. I am not ready\nyet. Wait a little. Keep very still, all you three! If you move I strike, and\nif you do not move I strike. Oh, foolish people, who killed my Nag!”\n</p><p>\nTeddy’s eyes were fixed on his father, and all his father could do was to\nwhisper, “Sit still, Teddy. You mustn’t move. Teddy, keep still.”\n</p><p>\nThen Rikki-tikki came up and cried, “Turn round, Nagaina. Turn and fight!”\n</p><p>\n“All in good time,” said she, without moving her eyes. “I will settle my\naccount with you presently. Look at your friends, Rikki-tikki. They are still\nand white. They are afraid. They dare not move, and if you come a step nearer I\nstrike.”\n</p><p>\n“Look at your eggs,” said Rikki-tikki, “in the melon bed near the wall. Go and\nlook, Nagaina!”\n</p><p>\nThe big snake turned half around, and saw the egg on the veranda. “Ah-h! Give\nit to me,” she said.\n</p><p>\nRikki-tikki put his paws one on each side of the egg, and his eyes were\nblood-red. “What price for a snake’s egg? For a young cobra? For a young king\ncobra? For the last—the very last of the brood? The ants are eating all the\nothers down by the melon bed.”\n</p><p>\nNagaina spun clear round, forgetting everything for the sake of the one egg.\nRikki-tikki saw Teddy’s father shoot out a big hand, catch Teddy by the\nshoulder, and drag him across the little table with the tea-cups, safe and out\nof reach of Nagaina.\n</p><p>\n“Tricked! Tricked! Tricked! Rikk-tck-tck!” chuckled Rikki-tikki. “The boy is\nsafe, and it was I—I—I that caught Nag by the hood last night in the bathroom.”\nThen he began to jump up and down, all four feet together, his head close to\nthe floor. “He threw me to and fro, but he could not shake me off. He was dead\nbefore the big man blew him in two. I did it! Rikki-tikki-tck-tck! Come then,\nNagaina. Come and fight with me. You shall not be a widow long.”\n</p><p>\nNagaina saw that she had lost her chance of killing Teddy, and the egg lay\nbetween Rikki-tikki’s paws. “Give me the egg, Rikki-tikki. Give me the last of\nmy eggs, and I will go away and never come back,” she said, lowering her hood.\n</p><p>\n“Yes, you will go away, and you will never come back. For you will go to the\nrubbish heap with Nag. Fight, widow! The big man has gone for his gun! Fight!”\n</p><div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%;\">\n<img alt=\"{0227}\" src=\"images/{0227}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">Nagaina flew down the path, with Rikki-tikki behind her.</p>\n</div><img alt=\"{0227}\" src=\"images/{0227}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/><p class=\"caption\">Nagaina flew down the path, with Rikki-tikki behind her.</p><p>\nRikki-tikki was bounding all round Nagaina, keeping just out of reach of her\nstroke, his little eyes like hot coals. Nagaina gathered herself together and\nflung out at him. Rikki-tikki jumped up and backward. Again and again and again\nshe struck, and each time her head came with a whack on the matting of the\nveranda and she gathered herself together like a watch spring. Then Rikki-tikki\ndanced in a circle to get behind her, and Nagaina spun round to keep her head\nto his head, so that the rustle of her tail on the matting sounded like dry\nleaves blown along by the wind.\n</p><p>\nHe had forgotten the egg. It still lay on the veranda, and Nagaina came nearer\nand nearer to it, till at last, while Rikki-tikki was drawing breath, she\ncaught it in her mouth, turned to the veranda steps, and flew like an arrow\ndown the path, with Rikki-tikki behind her. When the cobra runs for her life,\nshe goes like a whip-lash flicked across a horse’s neck.\n</p><p>\nRikki-tikki knew that he must catch her, or all the trouble would begin again.\nShe headed straight for the long grass by the thorn-bush, and as he was running\nRikki-tikki heard Darzee still singing his foolish little song of triumph. But\nDarzee’s wife was wiser. She flew off her nest as Nagaina came along, and\nflapped her wings about Nagaina’s head. If Darzee had helped they might have\nturned her, but Nagaina only lowered her hood and went on. Still, the instant’s\ndelay brought Rikki-tikki up to her, and as she plunged into the rat-hole where\nshe and Nag used to live, his little white teeth were clenched on her tail, and\nhe went down with her—and very few mongooses, however wise and old they may be,\ncare to follow a cobra into its hole. It was dark in the hole; and Rikki-tikki\nnever knew when it might open out and give Nagaina room to turn and strike at\nhim. He held on savagely, and stuck out his feet to act as brakes on the dark\nslope of the hot, moist earth.\n</p><p>\nThen the grass by the mouth of the hole stopped waving, and Darzee said, “It is\nall over with Rikki-tikki! We must sing his death song. Valiant Rikki-tikki is\ndead! For Nagaina will surely kill him underground.”\n</p><p>\nSo he sang a very mournful song that he made up on the spur of the minute, and\njust as he got to the most touching part, the grass quivered again, and\nRikki-tikki, covered with dirt, dragged himself out of the hole leg by leg,\nlicking his whiskers. Darzee stopped with a little shout. Rikki-tikki shook\nsome of the dust out of his fur and sneezed. “It is all over,” he said. “The\nwidow will never come out again.” And the red ants that live between the grass\nstems heard him, and began to troop down one after another to see if he had\nspoken the truth.\n</p><p>\nRikki-tikki curled himself up in the grass and slept where he was—slept and\nslept till it was late in the afternoon, for he had done a hard day’s work.\n</p><p>\n“Now,” he said, when he awoke, “I will go back to the house. Tell the\nCoppersmith, Darzee, and he will tell the garden that Nagaina is dead.”\n</p><div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%;\">\n<img alt=\"{0230}\" src=\"images/{0230}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">It is all over.</p>\n</div><img alt=\"{0230}\" src=\"images/{0230}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/><p class=\"caption\">It is all over.</p><p>\nThe Coppersmith is a bird who makes a noise exactly like the beating of a\nlittle hammer on a copper pot; and the reason he is always making it is because\nhe is the town crier to every Indian garden, and tells all the news to\neverybody who cares to listen. As Rikki-tikki went up the path, he heard his\n“attention” notes like a tiny dinner gong, and then the steady “Ding-dong-tock!\nNag is dead—dong! Nagaina is dead! Ding-dong-tock!” That set all the birds in\nthe garden singing, and the frogs croaking, for Nag and Nagaina used to eat\nfrogs as well as little birds.\n</p><p>\nWhen Rikki got to the house, Teddy and Teddy’s mother (she looked very white\nstill, for she had been fainting) and Teddy’s father came out and almost cried\nover him; and that night he ate all that was given him till he could eat no\nmore, and went to bed on Teddy’s shoulder, where Teddy’s mother saw him when\nshe came to look late at night.\n</p><p>\n“He saved our lives and Teddy’s life,” she said to her husband. “Just think, he\nsaved all our lives.”\n</p><p>\nRikki-tikki woke up with a jump, for the mongooses are light sleepers.\n</p><p>\n“Oh, it’s you,” said he. “What are you bothering for? All the cobras are dead.\nAnd if they weren’t, I’m here.”\n</p><p>\nRikki-tikki had a right to be proud of himself. But he did not grow too proud,\nand he kept that garden as a mongoose should keep it, with tooth and jump and\nspring and bite, till never a cobra dared show its head inside the walls.\n</p>"
