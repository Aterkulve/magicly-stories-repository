It is a sort of very sad seal\nNational Anthem.\n</p><p class=\"poem\">\nI met my mates in the morning (and, oh, but I am old!)<br/>\nWhere roaring on the ledges the summer ground-swell rolled;<br/>\nI heard them lift the chorus that drowned the breakers’ song—<br/>\nThe Beaches of Lukannon—two million voices strong.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>The song of pleasant stations beside the salt lagoons,<br/>\nThe song of blowing squadrons that shuffled down the dunes,<br/>\nThe song of midnight dances that churned the sea to flame—<br/>\nThe Beaches of Lukannon—before the sealers came!</i><br/>\n<br/>\nI met my mates in the morning (I’ll never meet them more!);<br/>\nThey came and went in legions that darkened all the shore.<br/>\nAnd o’er the foam-flecked offing as far as voice could reach<br/>\nWe hailed the landing-parties and we sang them up the beach.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>The Beaches of Lukannon—the winter wheat so tall—<br/>\nThe dripping, crinkled lichens, and the sea-fog drenching all!<br/>\nThe platforms of our playground, all shining smooth and worn!<br/>\nThe Beaches of Lukannon—the home where we were born!</i><br/>\n<br/>\nI met my mates in the morning, a broken, scattered band.<br/>\nMen shoot us in the water and club us on the land;<br/>\nMen drive us to the Salt House like silly sheep and tame,<br/>\nAnd still we sing Lukannon—before the sealers came.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Wheel down, wheel down to southward; oh, Gooverooska, go!<br/>\nAnd tell the Deep-Sea Viceroys the story of our woe;<br/>\nEre, empty as the shark’s egg the tempest flings ashore,<br/>\nThe Beaches of Lukannon shall know their sons no more!</i>\n</p><div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%;\">\n<img alt=\"{0195}\" src=\"images/{0195}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n</div><img alt=\"{0195}\" src=\"images/{0195}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>"
