Wonderful!  Once again!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow we are talking just like men!<br/>\n    Let’s pretend we are ... never mind,<br/>\n    <i>Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!</i><br/>\n    This is the way of the Monkey-kind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Then join our leaping lines that scumfish through the pines,<br/>\nThat rocket by where, light and high, the wild grape swings.<br/>\nBy the rubbish in our wake, and the noble noise we make,<br/>\nBe sure, be sure, we’re going to do some splendid things!</i>\n</p><div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:50%;\">\n<img alt=\"{0113}\" src=\"images/{0113}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n</div><img alt=\"{0113}\" src=\"images/{0113}.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>"
