  "content": "<p>I hope you want to know what became of the other boys. They were waiting below\nto give Wendy time to explain about them; and when they had counted five\nhundred they went up. They went up by the stair, because they thought this\nwould make a better impression. They stood in a row in front of Mrs. Darling,\nwith their hats off, and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes.\nThey said nothing, but their eyes asked her to have them. They ought to have\nlooked at Mr. Darling also, but they forgot about him.</p>\n<p>Of course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them; but Mr. Darling\nwas curiously depressed, and they saw that he considered six a rather large\nnumber.</p>\n<p>“I must say,” he said to Wendy, “that you don’t do\nthings by halves,” a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed\nat them.</p>\n<p>The first twin was the proud one, and he asked, flushing, “Do you think\nwe should be too much of a handful, sir? Because, if so, we can go away.”</p>\n<p>“Father!” Wendy cried, shocked; but still the cloud was on him. He\nknew he was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it.</p>\n<p>“We could lie doubled up,” said Nibs.</p>\n<p>“I always cut their hair myself,” said Wendy.</p>\n<p>“George!” Mrs. Darling exclaimed, pained to see her dear one\nshowing himself in such an unfavourable light.</p>\n<p>Then he burst into tears, and the truth came out. He was as glad to have them\nas she was, he said, but he thought they should have asked his consent as well\nas hers, instead of treating him as a cypher in his own house.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think he is a cypher,” Tootles cried instantly.\n“Do you think he is a cypher, Curly?”</p>\n<p>“No, I don’t. Do you think he is a cypher, Slightly?”</p>\n<p>“Rather not. Twin, what do you think?”</p>\n<p>It turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher; and he was absurdly\ngratified, and said he would find space for them all in the drawing-room if\nthey fitted in.</p>\n<p>“We’ll fit in, sir,” they assured him.</p>\n<p>“Then follow the leader,” he cried gaily. “Mind you, I am not\nsure that we have a drawing-room, but we pretend we have, and it’s all\nthe same. Hoop la!”</p>\n<p>He went off dancing through the house, and they all cried “Hoop\nla!” and danced after him, searching for the drawing-room; and I forget\nwhether they found it, but at any rate they found corners, and they all fitted\nin.</p>\n<p>As for Peter, he saw Wendy once again before he flew away. He did not exactly\ncome to the window, but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open\nit if she liked and call to him. That is what she did.</p>\n<p>“Hullo, Wendy, good-bye,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Oh dear, are you going away?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“You don’t feel, Peter,” she said falteringly, “that\nyou would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject?”</p>\n<p>“No.”</p>\n<p>“About me, Peter?”</p>\n<p>“No.”</p>\n<p>Mrs. Darling came to the window, for at present she was keeping a sharp eye on\nWendy. She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys, and would like\nto adopt him also.</p>\n<p>“Would you send me to school?” he inquired craftily.</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“And then to an office?”</p>\n<p>“I suppose so.”</p>\n<p>“Soon I would be a man?”</p>\n<p>“Very soon.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want to go to school and learn solemn things,” he\ntold her passionately. “I don’t want to be a man. O Wendy’s\nmother, if I was to wake up and feel there was a beard!”</p>\n<p>“Peter,” said Wendy the comforter, “I should love you in a\nbeard;” and Mrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him, but he repulsed\nher.</p>\n<p>“Keep back, lady, no one is going to catch me and make me a man.”</p>\n<p>“But where are you going to live?”</p>\n<p>“With Tink in the house we built for Wendy. The fairies are to put it\nhigh up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights.”</p>\n<p>“How lovely,” cried Wendy so longingly that Mrs. Darling tightened\nher grip.</p>\n<p>“I thought all the fairies were dead,” Mrs. Darling said.</p>\n<p>“There are always a lot of young ones,” explained Wendy, who was\nnow quite an authority, “because you see when a new baby laughs for the\nfirst time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies there are\nalways new fairies. They live in nests on the tops of trees; and the mauve ones\nare boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue ones are just little\nsillies who are not sure what they are.”</p>\n<p>“I shall have such fun,” said Peter, with eye on Wendy.</p>\n<p>“It will be rather lonely in the evening,” she said, “sitting\nby the fire.”</p>\n<p>“I shall have Tink.”</p>\n<p>“Tink can’t go a twentieth part of the way round,” she\nreminded him a little tartly.</p>\n<p>“Sneaky tell-tale!” Tink called out from somewhere round the\ncorner.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter,” Peter said.</p>\n<p>“O Peter, you know it matters.”</p>\n<p>“Well, then, come with me to the little house.”</p>\n<p>“May I, mummy?”</p>\n<p>“Certainly not. I have got you home again, and I mean to keep you.”</p>\n<p>“But he does so need a mother.”</p>\n<p>“So do you, my love.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, all right,” Peter said, as if he had asked her from politeness\nmerely; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch, and she made this handsome\noffer: to let Wendy go to him for a week every year to do his spring cleaning.\nWendy would have preferred a more permanent arrangement; and it seemed to her\nthat spring would be long in coming; but this promise sent Peter away quite gay\nagain. He had no sense of time, and was so full of adventures that all I have\ntold you about him is only a halfpenny-worth of them. I suppose it was because\nWendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones:</p>\n<p>“You won’t forget me, Peter, will you, before spring cleaning time\ncomes?”</p>\n<p>Of course Peter promised; and then he flew away. He took Mrs. Darling’s\nkiss with him. The kiss that had been for no one else, Peter took quite easily.\nFunny. But she seemed satisfied.</p>\n<p>Of course all the boys went to school; and most of them got into Class III, but\nSlightly was put first into Class IV and then into Class V. Class I is the top\nclass. Before they had attended school a week they saw what goats they had been\nnot to remain on the island; but it was too late now, and soon they settled\ndown to being as ordinary as you or me or Jenkins minor. It is sad to have to\nsay that the power to fly gradually left them. At first Nana tied their feet to\nthe bed-posts so that they should not fly away in the night; and one of their\ndiversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses; but by and by they ceased\nto tug at their bonds in bed, and found that they hurt themselves when they let\ngo of the bus. In time they could not even fly after their hats. Want of\npractice, they called it; but what it really meant was that they no longer\nbelieved.</p>\n<p>Michael believed longer than the other boys, though they jeered at him; so he\nwas with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end of the first year. She flew\naway with Peter in the frock she had woven from leaves and berries in the\nNeverland, and her one fear was that he might notice how short it had become;\nbut he never noticed, he had so much to say about himself.</p>\n<p>She had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times, but new\nadventures had crowded the old ones from his mind.</p>\n<p>“Who is Captain Hook?” he asked with interest when she spoke of the\narch enemy.</p>\n<p>“Don’t you remember,” she asked, amazed, “how you\nkilled him and saved all our lives?”</p>\n<p>“I forget them after I kill them,” he replied carelessly.</p>\n<p>When she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to see her he\nsaid, “Who is Tinker Bell?”</p>\n<p>“O Peter,” she said, shocked; but even when she explained he could\nnot remember.</p>\n<p>“There are such a lot of them,” he said. “I expect she is no\nmore.”</p>\n<p>I expect he was right, for fairies don’t live long, but they are so\nlittle that a short time seems a good while to them.</p>\n<p>Wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to Peter;\nit had seemed such a long year of waiting to her. But he was exactly as\nfascinating as ever, and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house\non the tree tops.</p>\n<p>Next year he did not come for her. She waited in a new frock because the old\none simply would not meet; but he never came.</p>\n<p>“Perhaps he is ill,” Michael said.</p>\n<p>“You know he is never ill.”</p>\n<p>Michael came close to her and whispered, with a shiver, “Perhaps there is\nno such person, Wendy!” and then Wendy would have cried if Michael had\nnot been crying.</p>\n<p>Peter came next spring cleaning; and the strange thing was that he never knew\nhe had missed a year.</p>\n<p>That was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him. For a little longer she\ntried for his sake not to have growing pains; and she felt she was untrue to\nhim when she got a prize for general knowledge. But the years came and went\nwithout bringing the careless boy; and when they met again Wendy was a married\nwoman, and Peter was no more to her than a little dust in the box in which she\nhad kept her toys. Wendy was grown up. You need not be sorry for her. She was\none of the kind that likes to grow up. In the end she grew up of her own free\nwill a day quicker than other girls.</p>\n<p>All the boys were grown up and done for by this time; so it is scarcely worth\nwhile saying anything more about them. You may see the twins and Nibs and Curly\nany day going to an office, each carrying a little bag and an umbrella. Michael\nis an engine-driver. Slightly married a lady of title, and so he became a lord.\nYou see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door? That used to be\nTootles. The bearded man who doesn’t know any story to tell his children\nwas once John.</p>\n<p>Wendy was married in white with a pink sash. It is strange to think that Peter\ndid not alight in the church and forbid the banns.</p>\n<p>Years rolled on again, and Wendy had a daughter. This ought not to be written\nin ink but in a golden splash.</p>\n<p>She was called Jane, and always had an odd inquiring look, as if from the\nmoment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions. When she was\nold enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan. She loved to hear of\nPeter, and Wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which\nthe famous flight had taken place. It was Jane’s nursery now, for her\nfather had bought it at the three per cents from Wendy’s father, who was\nno longer fond of stairs. Mrs. Darling was now dead and forgotten.</p>\n<p>There were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane’s and her\nnurse’s; and there was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away. She died\nof old age, and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with; being\nvery firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except\nherself.</p>\n<p>Once a week Jane’s nurse had her evening off; and then it was\nWendy’s part to put Jane to bed. That was the time for stories. It was\nJane’s invention to raise the sheet over her mother’s head and her\nown, thus making a tent, and in the awful darkness to whisper:</p>\n<p>“What do we see now?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t think I see anything to-night,” says Wendy, with a\nfeeling that if Nana were here she would object to further conversation.</p>\n<p>“Yes, you do,” says Jane, “you see when you were a little\ngirl.”</p>\n<p>“That is a long time ago, sweetheart,” says Wendy. “Ah me,\nhow time flies!”</p>\n<p>“Does it fly,” asks the artful child, “the way you flew when\nyou were a little girl?”</p>\n<p>“The way I flew? Do you know, Jane, I sometimes wonder whether I ever did\nreally fly.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, you did.”</p>\n<p>“The dear old days when I could fly!”</p>\n<p>“Why can’t you fly now, mother?”</p>\n<p>“Because I am grown up, dearest. When people grow up they forget the\nway.”</p>\n<p>“Why do they forget the way?”</p>\n<p>“Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless. It is only\nthe gay and innocent and heartless who can fly.”</p>\n<p>“What is gay and innocent and heartless? I do wish I were gay and\ninnocent and heartless.”</p>\n<p>Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something.</p>\n<p>“I do believe,” she says, “that it is this nursery.”</p>\n<p>“I do believe it is,” says Jane. “Go on.”</p>\n<p>They are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter flew in\nlooking for his shadow.</p>\n<p>“The foolish fellow,” says Wendy, “tried to stick it on with\nsoap, and when he could not he cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on for\nhim.”</p>\n<p>“You have missed a bit,” interrupts Jane, who now knows the story\nbetter than her mother. “When you saw him sitting on the floor crying,\nwhat did you say?”</p>\n<p>“I sat up in bed and I said, ‘Boy, why are you\ncrying?’”</p>\n<p>“Yes, that was it,” says Jane, with a big breath.</p>\n<p>“And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the\npirates and the redskins and the mermaids’ lagoon, and the home under the\nground, and the little house.”</p>\n<p>“Yes! which did you like best of all?”</p>\n<p>“I think I liked the home under the ground best of all.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, so do I. What was the last thing Peter ever said to you?”</p>\n<p>“The last thing he ever said to me was, ‘Just always be waiting for\nme, and then some night you will hear me crowing.’”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“But, alas, he forgot all about me,” Wendy said it with a smile.\nShe was as grown up as that.</p>\n<p>“What did his crow sound like?” Jane asked one evening.</p>\n<p>“It was like this,” Wendy said, trying to imitate Peter’s\ncrow.</p>\n<p>“No, it wasn’t,” Jane said gravely, “it was like\nthis;” and she did it ever so much better than her mother.</p>\n<p>Wendy was a little startled. “My darling, how can you know?”</p>\n<p>“I often hear it when I am sleeping,” Jane said.</p>\n<p>“Ah yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I was the only\none who heard it awake.”</p>\n<p>“Lucky you,” said Jane.</p>\n<p>And then one night came the tragedy. It was the spring of the year, and the\nstory had been told for the night, and Jane was now asleep in her bed. Wendy\nwas sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to see to darn, for\nthere was no other light in the nursery; and while she sat darning she heard a\ncrow. Then the window blew open as of old, and Peter dropped in on the floor.</p>\n<p>He was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he still had all\nhis first teeth.</p>\n<p>He was a little boy, and she was grown up. She huddled by the fire not daring\nto move, helpless and guilty, a big woman.</p>\n<p>“Hullo, Wendy,” he said, not noticing any difference, for he was\nthinking chiefly of himself; and in the dim light her white dress might have\nbeen the nightgown in which he had seen her first.</p>\n<p>“Hullo, Peter,” she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small as\npossible. Something inside her was crying “Woman, Woman, let go of\nme.”</p>\n<p>“Hullo, where is John?” he asked, suddenly missing the third bed.</p>\n<p>“John is not here now,” she gasped.</p>\n<p>“Is Michael asleep?” he asked, with a careless glance at Jane.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” she answered; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane\nas well as to Peter.</p>\n<p>“That is not Michael,” she said quickly, lest a judgment should\nfall on her.</p>\n<p>Peter looked. “Hullo, is it a new one?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“Boy or girl?”</p>\n<p>“Girl.”</p>\n<p>Now surely he would understand; but not a bit of it.</p>\n<p>“Peter,” she said, faltering, “are you expecting me to fly\naway with you?”</p>\n<p>“Of course; that is why I have come.” He added a little sternly,\n“Have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?”</p>\n<p>She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass.</p>\n<p>“I can’t come,” she said apologetically, “I have\nforgotten how to fly.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll soon teach you again.”</p>\n<p>“O Peter, don’t waste the fairy dust on me.”</p>\n<p>She had risen; and now at last a fear assailed him. “What is it?”\nhe cried, shrinking.</p>\n<p>“I will turn up the light,” she said, “and then you can see\nfor yourself.”</p>\n<p>For almost the only time in his life that I know of, Peter was afraid.\n“Don’t turn up the light,” he cried.</p>\n<p>She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy. She was not a little girl\nheart-broken about him; she was a grown woman smiling at it all, but they were\nwet-eyed smiles.</p>\n<p>Then she turned up the light, and Peter saw. He gave a cry of pain; and when\nthe tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back\nsharply.</p>\n<p>“What is it?” he cried again.</p>\n<p>She had to tell him.</p>\n<p>“I am old, Peter. I am ever so much more than twenty. I grew up long\nago.”</p>\n<p>“You promised not to!”</p>\n<p>“I couldn’t help it. I am a married woman, Peter.”</p>\n<p>“No, you’re not.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby.”</p>\n<p>“No, she’s not.”</p>\n<p>But he supposed she was; and he took a step towards the sleeping child with his\ndagger upraised. Of course he did not strike. He sat down on the floor instead\nand sobbed; and Wendy did not know how to comfort him, though she could have\ndone it so easily once. She was only a woman now, and she ran out of the room\nto try to think.</p>\n<p>Peter continued to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane. She sat up in bed, and was\ninterested at once.</p>\n<p>“Boy,” she said, “why are you crying?”</p>\n<p>Peter rose and bowed to her, and she bowed to him from the bed.</p>\n<p>“Hullo,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Hullo,” said Jane.</p>\n<p>“My name is Peter Pan,” he told her.</p>\n<p>“Yes, I know.”</p>\n<p>“I came back for my mother,” he explained, “to take her to\nthe Neverland.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I know,” Jane said, “I have been waiting for\nyou.”</p>\n<p>When Wendy returned diffidently she found Peter sitting on the bed-post crowing\ngloriously, while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room in solemn\necstasy.</p>\n<p>“She is my mother,” Peter explained; and Jane descended and stood\nby his side, with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when they\ngazed at him.</p>\n<p>“He does so need a mother,” Jane said.</p>\n<p>“Yes, I know,” Wendy admitted rather forlornly; “no one knows\nit so well as I.”</p>\n<p>“Good-bye,” said Peter to Wendy; and he rose in the air, and the\nshameless Jane rose with him; it was already her easiest way of moving about.</p>\n<p>Wendy rushed to the window.</p>\n<p>“No, no,” she cried.</p>\n<p>“It is just for spring cleaning time,” Jane said, “he wants\nme always to do his spring cleaning.”</p>\n<p>“If only I could go with you,” Wendy sighed.</p>\n<p>“You see you can’t fly,” said Jane.</p>\n<p>Of course in the end Wendy let them fly away together. Our last glimpse of her\nshows her at the window, watching them receding into the sky until they were as\nsmall as stars.</p>\n<p>As you look at Wendy, you may see her hair becoming white, and her figure\nlittle again, for all this happened long ago. Jane is now a common grown-up,\nwith a daughter called Margaret; and every spring cleaning time, except when he\nforgets, Peter comes for Margaret and takes her to the Neverland, where she\ntells him stories about himself, to which he listens eagerly. When Margaret\ngrows up she will have a daughter, who is to be Peter’s mother in turn;\nand thus it will go on, so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.</p>\n<p>THE END</p>"
