  "content": "<p>\nWhen Toad found himself immured in a dank and noisome dungeon, and knew that\nall the grim darkness of a medieval fortress lay between him and the outer\nworld of sunshine and well-metalled high roads where he had lately been so\nhappy, disporting himself as if he had bought up every road in England, he\nflung himself at full length on the floor, and shed bitter tears, and abandoned\nhimself to dark despair. “This is the end of everything” (he said),\n“at least it is the end of the career of Toad, which is the same thing;\nthe popular and handsome Toad, the rich and hospitable Toad, the Toad so free\nand careless and debonair! How can I hope to be ever set at large again”\n(he said), “who have been imprisoned so justly for stealing so handsome a\nmotor-car in such an audacious manner, and for such lurid and imaginative\ncheek, bestowed upon such a number of fat, red-faced policemen!” (Here\nhis sobs choked him.) “Stupid animal that I was” (he said),\n“now I must languish in this dungeon, till people who were proud to say\nthey knew me, have forgotten the very name of Toad! O wise old Badger!”\n(he said), “O clever, intelligent Rat and sensible Mole! What sound\njudgments, what a knowledge of men and matters you possess! O unhappy and\nforsaken Toad!” With lamentations such as these he passed his days and\nnights for several weeks, refusing his meals or intermediate light\nrefreshments, though the grim and ancient gaoler, knowing that Toad’s\npockets were well lined, frequently pointed out that many comforts, and indeed\nluxuries, could by arrangement be sent in—at a price—from outside.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow the gaoler had a daughter, a pleasant wench and good-hearted, who assisted\nher father in the lighter duties of his post. She was particularly fond of\nanimals, and, besides her canary, whose cage hung on a nail in the massive wall\nof the keep by day, to the great annoyance of prisoners who relished an\nafter-dinner nap, and was shrouded in an antimacassar on the parlour table at\nnight, she kept several piebald mice and a restless revolving squirrel. This\nkind-hearted girl, pitying the misery of Toad, said to her father one day,\n“Father! I can’t bear to see that poor beast so unhappy, and\ngetting so thin! You let me have the managing of him. You know how fond of\nanimals I am. I’ll make him eat from my hand, and sit up, and do all\nsorts of things.”\n</p>\n<p>\nHer father replied that she could do what she liked with him. He was tired of\nToad, and his sulks and his airs and his meanness. So that day she went on her\nerrand of mercy, and knocked at the door of Toad’s cell.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Now, cheer up, Toad,” she said, coaxingly, on entering, “and\nsit up and dry your eyes and be a sensible animal. And do try and eat a bit of\ndinner. See, I’ve brought you some of mine, hot from the oven!”\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was bubble-and-squeak, between two plates, and its fragrance filled the\nnarrow cell. The penetrating smell of cabbage reached the nose of Toad as he\nlay prostrate in his misery on the floor, and gave him the idea for a moment\nthat perhaps life was not such a blank and desperate thing as he had imagined.\nBut still he wailed, and kicked with his legs, and refused to be comforted. So\nthe wise girl retired for the time, but, of course, a good deal of the smell of\nhot cabbage remained behind, as it will do, and Toad, between his sobs, sniffed\nand reflected, and gradually began to think new and inspiring thoughts: of\nchivalry, and poetry, and deeds still to be done; of broad meadows, and cattle\nbrowsing in them, raked by sun and wind; of kitchen-gardens, and straight\nherb-borders, and warm snap-dragon beset by bees; and of the comforting clink\nof dishes set down on the table at Toad Hall, and the scrape of chair-legs on\nthe floor as every one pulled himself close up to his work. The air of the\nnarrow cell took a rosy tinge; he began to think of his friends, and how they\nwould surely be able to do something; of lawyers, and how they would have\nenjoyed his case, and what an ass he had been not to get in a few; and lastly,\nhe thought of his own great cleverness and resource, and all that he was\ncapable of if he only gave his great mind to it; and the cure was almost\ncomplete.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen the girl returned, some hours later, she carried a tray, with a cup of\nfragrant tea steaming on it; and a plate piled up with very hot buttered toast,\ncut thick, very brown on both sides, with the butter running through the holes\nin it in great golden drops, like honey from the honeycomb. The smell of that\nbuttered toast simply talked to Toad, and with no uncertain voice; talked of\nwarm kitchens, of breakfasts on bright frosty mornings, of cosy parlour\nfiresides on winter evenings, when one’s ramble was over and slippered\nfeet were propped on the fender; of the purring of contented cats, and the\ntwitter of sleepy canaries. Toad sat up on end once more, dried his eyes,\nsipped his tea and munched his toast, and soon began talking freely about\nhimself, and the house he lived in, and his doings there, and how important he\nwas, and what a lot his friends thought of him.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe gaoler’s daughter saw that the topic was doing him as much good as\nthe tea, as indeed it was, and encouraged him to go on.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Tell me about Toad Hall,” said she. “It sounds\nbeautiful.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Toad Hall,” said the Toad proudly, “is an eligible\nself-contained gentleman’s residence very unique; dating in part from the\nfourteenth century, but replete with every modern convenience. Up-to-date\nsanitation. Five minutes from church, post-office, and golf-links, Suitable\nfor——”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Bless the animal,” said the girl, laughing, “I don’t\nwant to <i>take</i> it. Tell me something <i>real</i> about it. But first wait till I fetch\nyou some more tea and toast.”\n</p>\n<p>\nShe tripped away, and presently returned with a fresh trayful; and Toad,\npitching into the toast with avidity, his spirits quite restored to their usual\nlevel, told her about the boathouse, and the fish-pond, and the old walled\nkitchen-garden; and about the pig-styes, and the stables, and the pigeon-house,\nand the hen-house; and about the dairy, and the wash-house, and the\nchina-cupboards, and the linen-presses (she liked that bit especially); and\nabout the banqueting-hall, and the fun they had there when the other animals\nwere gathered round the table and Toad was at his best, singing songs, telling\nstories, carrying on generally. Then she wanted to know about his\nanimal-friends, and was very interested in all he had to tell her about them\nand how they lived, and what they did to pass their time. Of course, she did\nnot say she was fond of animals as <i>pets</i>, because she had the sense to see that\nToad would be extremely offended. When she said good night, having filled his\nwater-jug and shaken up his straw for him, Toad was very much the same\nsanguine, self-satisfied animal that he had been of old. He sang a little song\nor two, of the sort he used to sing at his dinner-parties, curled himself up in\nthe straw, and had an excellent night’s rest and the pleasantest of\ndreams.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey had many interesting talks together, after that, as the dreary days went\non; and the gaoler’s daughter grew very sorry for Toad, and thought it a\ngreat shame that a poor little animal should be locked up in prison for what\nseemed to her a very trivial offence. Toad, of course, in his vanity, thought\nthat her interest in him proceeded from a growing tenderness; and he could not\nhelp half-regretting that the social gulf between them was so very wide, for\nshe was a comely lass, and evidently admired him very much.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne morning the girl was very thoughtful, and answered at random, and did not\nseem to Toad to be paying proper attention to his witty sayings and sparkling\ncomments.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Toad,” she said presently, “just listen, please. I have an\naunt who is a washerwoman.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“There, there,” said Toad, graciously and affably, “never\nmind; think no more about it. <i>I</i> have several aunts who <i>ought</i> to be\nwasherwomen.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Do be quiet a minute, Toad,” said the girl. “You talk too\nmuch, that’s your chief fault, and I’m trying to think, and you\nhurt my head. As I said, I have an aunt who is a washerwoman; she does the\nwashing for all the prisoners in this castle—we try to keep any paying\nbusiness of that sort in the family, you understand. She takes out the washing\non Monday morning, and brings it in on Friday evening. This is a Thursday. Now,\nthis is what occurs to me: you’re very rich—at least you’re\nalways telling me so—and she’s very poor. A few pounds\nwouldn’t make any difference to you, and it would mean a lot to her. Now,\nI think if she were properly approached—squared, I believe is the word\nyou animals use—you could come to some arrangement by which she would let\nyou have her dress and bonnet and so on, and you could escape from the castle\nas the official washerwoman. You’re very alike in many\nrespects—particularly about the figure.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“We’re <i>not</i>,” said the Toad in a huff. “I have a very\nelegant figure—for what I am.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“So has my aunt,” replied the girl, “for what <i>she</i> is. But\nhave it your own way. You horrid, proud, ungrateful animal, when I’m\nsorry for you, and trying to help you!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Yes, yes, that’s all right; thank you very much indeed,”\nsaid the Toad hurriedly. “But look here! you wouldn’t surely have\nMr. Toad of Toad Hall, going about the country disguised as a\nwasherwoman!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Then you can stop here as a Toad,” replied the girl with much\nspirit. “I suppose you want to go off in a coach-and-four!”\n</p>\n<p>\nHonest Toad was always ready to admit himself in the wrong. “You are a\ngood, kind, clever girl,” he said, “and I am indeed a proud and a\nstupid toad. Introduce me to your worthy aunt, if you will be so kind, and I\nhave no doubt that the excellent lady and I will be able to arrange terms\nsatisfactory to both parties.”\n</p>\n<p>\nNext evening the girl ushered her aunt into Toad’s cell, bearing his\nweek’s washing pinned up in a towel. The old lady had been prepared\nbeforehand for the interview, and the sight of certain gold sovereigns that\nToad had thoughtfully placed on the table in full view practically completed\nthe matter and left little further to discuss. In return for his cash, Toad\nreceived a cotton print gown, an apron, a shawl, and a rusty black bonnet; the\nonly stipulation the old lady made being that she should be gagged and bound\nand dumped down in a corner. By this not very convincing artifice, she\nexplained, aided by picturesque fiction which she could supply herself, she\nhoped to retain her situation, in spite of the suspicious appearance of things.\n</p>\n<p>\nToad was delighted with the suggestion. It would enable him to leave the prison\nin some style, and with his reputation for being a desperate and dangerous\nfellow untarnished; and he readily helped the gaoler’s daughter to make\nher aunt appear as much as possible the victim of circumstances over which she\nhad no control.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Now it’s your turn, Toad,” said the girl. “Take off\nthat coat and waistcoat of yours; you’re fat enough as it is.”\n</p>\n<p>\nShaking with laughter, she proceeded to “hook-and-eye” him into the\ncotton print gown, arranged the shawl with a professional fold, and tied the\nstrings of the rusty bonnet under his chin.\n</p>\n<p>\n“You’re the very image of her,” she giggled, “only\nI’m sure you never looked half so respectable in all your life before.\nNow, good-bye, Toad, and good luck. Go straight down the way you came up; and\nif any one says anything to you, as they probably will, being but men, you can\nchaff back a bit, of course, but remember you’re a widow woman, quite\nalone in the world, with a character to lose.”\n</p>\n<p>\nWith a quaking heart, but as firm a footstep as he could command, Toad set\nforth cautiously on what seemed to be a most hare-brained and hazardous\nundertaking; but he was soon agreeably surprised to find how easy everything\nwas made for him, and a little humbled at the thought that both his popularity,\nand the sex that seemed to inspire it, were really another’s. The\nwasherwoman’s squat figure in its familiar cotton print seemed a passport\nfor every barred door and grim gateway; even when he hesitated, uncertain as to\nthe right turning to take, he found himself helped out of his difficulty by the\nwarder at the next gate, anxious to be off to his tea, summoning him to come\nalong sharp and not keep him waiting there all night. The chaff and the\nhumourous sallies to which he was subjected, and to which, of course, he had to\nprovide prompt and effective reply, formed, indeed, his chief danger; for Toad\nwas an animal with a strong sense of his own dignity, and the chaff was mostly\n(he thought) poor and clumsy, and the humour of the sallies entirely lacking.\nHowever, he kept his temper, though with great difficulty, suited his retorts\nto his company and his supposed character, and did his best not to overstep the\nlimits of good taste.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt seemed hours before he crossed the last courtyard, rejected the pressing\ninvitations from the last guardroom, and dodged the outspread arms of the last\nwarder, pleading with simulated passion for just one farewell embrace. But at\nlast he heard the wicket-gate in the great outer door click behind him, felt\nthe fresh air of the outer world upon his anxious brow, and knew that he was\nfree!\n</p>\n<p>\nDizzy with the easy success of his daring exploit, he walked quickly towards\nthe lights of the town, not knowing in the least what he should do next, only\nquite certain of one thing, that he must remove himself as quickly as possible\nfrom the neighbourhood where the lady he was forced to represent was so\nwell-known and so popular a character.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs he walked along, considering, his attention was caught by some red and green\nlights a little way off, to one side of the town, and the sound of the puffing\nand snorting of engines and the banging of shunted trucks fell on his ear.\n“Aha!” he thought, “this is a piece of luck! A railway\nstation is the thing I want most in the whole world at this moment; and\nwhat’s more, I needn’t go through the town to get it, and\nshan’t have to support this humiliating character by repartees which,\nthough thoroughly effective, do not assist one’s sense of\nself-respect.”\n</p>\n<p>\nHe made his way to the station accordingly, consulted a time-table, and found\nthat a train, bound more or less in the direction of his home, was due to start\nin half-an-hour. “More luck!” said Toad, his spirits rising\nrapidly, and went off to the booking-office to buy his ticket.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe gave the name of the station that he knew to be nearest to the village of\nwhich Toad Hall was the principal feature, and mechanically put his fingers, in\nsearch of the necessary money, where his waistcoat pocket should have been. But\nhere the cotton gown, which had nobly stood by him so far, and which he had\nbasely forgotten, intervened, and frustrated his efforts. In a sort of\nnightmare he struggled with the strange uncanny thing that seemed to hold his\nhands, turn all muscular strivings to water, and laugh at him all the time;\nwhile other travellers, forming up in a line behind, waited with impatience,\nmaking suggestions of more or less value and comments of more or less\nstringency and point. At last—somehow—he never rightly understood\nhow—he burst the barriers, attained the goal, arrived at where all\nwaistcoat pockets are eternally situated, and found—not only no money,\nbut no pocket to hold it, and no waistcoat to hold the pocket!\n</p>\n<p>\nTo his horror he recollected that he had left both coat and waistcoat behind\nhim in his cell, and with them his pocket-book, money, keys, watch, matches,\npencil-case—all that makes life worth living, all that distinguishes the\nmany-pocketed animal, the lord of creation, from the inferior one-pocketed or\nno-pocketed productions that hop or trip about permissively, unequipped for the\nreal contest.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn his misery he made one desperate effort to carry the thing off, and, with a\nreturn to his fine old manner—a blend of the Squire and the College\nDon—he said, “Look here! I find I’ve left my purse behind.\nJust give me that ticket, will you, and I’ll send the money on to-morrow?\nI’m well-known in these parts.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe clerk stared at him and the rusty black bonnet a moment, and then laughed.\n“I should think you were pretty well known in these parts,” he\nsaid, “if you’ve tried this game on often. Here, stand away from\nthe window, please, madam; you’re obstructing the other\npassengers!”\n</p>\n<p>\nAn old gentleman who had been prodding him in the back for some moments here\nthrust him away, and, what was worse, addressed him as his good woman, which\nangered Toad more than anything that had occurred that evening.\n</p>\n<p>\nBaffled and full of despair, he wandered blindly down the platform where the\ntrain was standing, and tears trickled down each side of his nose. It was hard,\nhe thought, to be within sight of safety and almost of home, and to be baulked\nby the want of a few wretched shillings and by the pettifogging mistrustfulness\nof paid officials. Very soon his escape would be discovered, the hunt would be\nup, he would be caught, reviled, loaded with chains, dragged back again to\nprison and bread-and-water and straw; his guards and penalties would be\ndoubled; and O, what sarcastic remarks the girl would make! What was to be\ndone? He was not swift of foot; his figure was unfortunately recognisable.\nCould he not squeeze under the seat of a carriage? He had seen this method\nadopted by schoolboys, when the journey-money provided by thoughtful parents\nhad been diverted to other and better ends. As he pondered, he found himself\nopposite the engine, which was being oiled, wiped, and generally caressed by\nits affectionate driver, a burly man with an oil-can in one hand and a lump of\ncotton-waste in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Hullo, mother!” said the engine-driver, “what’s the\ntrouble? You don’t look particularly cheerful.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“O, sir!” said Toad, crying afresh, “I am a poor unhappy\nwasherwoman, and I’ve lost all my money, and can’t pay for a\nticket, and I <i>must</i> get home to-night somehow, and whatever I am to do I\ndon’t know. O dear, O dear!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“That’s a bad business, indeed,” said the engine-driver\nreflectively. “Lost your money—and can’t get home—and\ngot some kids, too, waiting for you, I dare say?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Any amount of ’em,” sobbed Toad. “And they’ll be\nhungry—and playing with matches—and upsetting lamps, the little\ninnocents!—and quarrelling, and going on generally. O dear, O\ndear!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well, I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” said the good\nengine-driver. “You’re a washerwoman to your trade, says you. Very\nwell, that’s that. And I’m an engine-driver, as you well may see,\nand there’s no denying it’s terribly dirty work. Uses up a power of\nshirts, it does, till my missus is fair tired of washing of ’em. If\nyou’ll wash a few shirts for me when you get home, and send ’em\nalong, I’ll give you a ride on my engine. It’s against the\nCompany’s regulations, but we’re not so very particular in these\nout-of-the-way parts.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Toad’s misery turned into rapture as he eagerly scrambled up into the\ncab of the engine. Of course, he had never washed a shirt in his life, and\ncouldn’t if he tried and, anyhow, he wasn’t going to begin; but he\nthought: “When I get safely home to Toad Hall, and have money again, and\npockets to put it in, I will send the engine-driver enough to pay for quite a\nquantity of washing, and that will be the same thing, or better.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe guard waved his welcome flag, the engine-driver whistled in cheerful\nresponse, and the train moved out of the station. As the speed increased, and\nthe Toad could see on either side of him real fields, and trees, and hedges,\nand cows, and horses, all flying past him, and as he thought how every minute\nwas bringing him nearer to Toad Hall, and sympathetic friends, and money to\nchink in his pocket, and a soft bed to sleep in, and good things to eat, and\npraise and admiration at the recital of his adventures and his surpassing\ncleverness, he began to skip up and down and shout and sing snatches of song,\nto the great astonishment of the engine-driver, who had come across washerwomen\nbefore, at long intervals, but never one at all like this.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey had covered many and many a mile, and Toad was already considering what he\nwould have for supper as soon as he got home, when he noticed that the\nengine-driver, with a puzzled expression on his face, was leaning over the side\nof the engine and listening hard. Then he saw him climb on to the coals and\ngaze out over the top of the train; then he returned and said to Toad:\n“It’s very strange; we’re the last train running in this\ndirection to-night, yet I could be sworn that I heard another following\nus!”\n</p>\n<p>\nToad ceased his frivolous antics at once. He became grave and depressed, and a\ndull pain in the lower part of his spine, communicating itself to his legs,\nmade him want to sit down and try desperately not to think of all the\npossibilities.\n</p>\n<p>\nBy this time the moon was shining brightly, and the engine-driver, steadying\nhimself on the coal, could command a view of the line behind them for a long\ndistance.\n</p>\n<p>\nPresently he called out, “I can see it clearly now! It is an engine, on\nour rails, coming along at a great pace! It looks as if we were being\npursued!”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe miserable Toad, crouching in the coal-dust, tried hard to think of\nsomething to do, with dismal want of success.\n</p>\n<p>\n“They are gaining on us fast!” cried the engine-driver. And the\nengine is crowded with the queerest lot of people! Men like ancient warders,\nwaving halberds; policemen in their helmets, waving truncheons; and shabbily\ndressed men in pot-hats, obvious and unmistakable plain-clothes detectives even\nat this distance, waving revolvers and walking-sticks; all waving, and all\nshouting the same thing—‘Stop, stop, stop!’”\n</p>\n<p>\nThen Toad fell on his knees among the coals and, raising his clasped paws in\nsupplication, cried, “Save me, only save me, dear kind Mr. Engine-driver,\nand I will confess everything! I am not the simple washerwoman I seem to be! I\nhave no children waiting for me, innocent or otherwise! I am a toad—the\nwell-known and popular Mr. Toad, a landed proprietor; I have just escaped, by\nmy great daring and cleverness, from a loathsome dungeon into which my enemies\nhad flung me; and if those fellows on that engine recapture me, it will be\nchains and bread-and-water and straw and misery once more for poor, unhappy,\ninnocent Toad!”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe engine-driver looked down upon him very sternly, and said, “Now tell\nthe truth; what were you put in prison for?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“It was nothing very much,” said poor Toad, colouring deeply.\n“I only borrowed a motorcar while the owners were at lunch; they had no\nneed of it at the time. I didn’t mean to steal it, really; but\npeople—especially magistrates—take such harsh views of thoughtless\nand high-spirited actions.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe engine-driver looked very grave and said, “I fear that you have been\nindeed a wicked toad, and by rights I ought to give you up to offended justice.\nBut you are evidently in sore trouble and distress, so I will not desert you. I\ndon’t hold with motor-cars, for one thing; and I don’t hold with\nbeing ordered about by policemen when I’m on my own engine, for another.\nAnd the sight of an animal in tears always makes me feel queer and softhearted.\nSo cheer up, Toad! I’ll do my best, and we may beat them yet!”\n</p>\n<p>\nThey piled on more coals, shovelling furiously; the furnace roared, the sparks\nflew, the engine leapt and swung but still their pursuers slowly gained. The\nengine-driver, with a sigh, wiped his brow with a handful of cotton-waste, and\nsaid, “I’m afraid it’s no good, Toad. You see, they are\nrunning light, and they have the better engine. There’s just one thing\nleft for us to do, and it’s your only chance, so attend very carefully to\nwhat I tell you. A short way ahead of us is a long tunnel, and on the other\nside of that the line passes through a thick wood. Now, I will put on all the\nspeed I can while we are running through the tunnel, but the other fellows will\nslow down a bit, naturally, for fear of an accident. When we are through, I\nwill shut off steam and put on brakes as hard as I can, and the moment\nit’s safe to do so you must jump and hide in the wood, before they get\nthrough the tunnel and see you. Then I will go full speed ahead again, and they\ncan chase me if they like, for as long as they like, and as far as they like.\nNow mind and be ready to jump when I tell you!”\n</p>\n<p>\nThey piled on more coals, and the train shot into the tunnel, and the engine\nrushed and roared and rattled, till at last they shot out at the other end into\nfresh air and the peaceful moonlight, and saw the wood lying dark and helpful\nupon either side of the line. The driver shut off steam and put on brakes, the\nToad got down on the step, and as the train slowed down to almost a walking\npace he heard the driver call out, “Now, jump!”\n</p>\n<p>\nToad jumped, rolled down a short embankment, picked himself up unhurt,\nscrambled into the wood and hid.\n</p>\n<p>\nPeeping out, he saw his train get up speed again and disappear at a great pace.\nThen out of the tunnel burst the pursuing engine, roaring and whistling, her\nmotley crew waving their various weapons and shouting, “Stop! stop!\nstop!” When they were past, the Toad had a hearty laugh—for the\nfirst time since he was thrown into prison.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut he soon stopped laughing when he came to consider that it was now very late\nand dark and cold, and he was in an unknown wood, with no money and no chance\nof supper, and still far from friends and home; and the dead silence of\neverything, after the roar and rattle of the train, was something of a shock.\nHe dared not leave the shelter of the trees, so he struck into the wood, with\nthe idea of leaving the railway as far as possible behind him.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter so many weeks within walls, he found the wood strange and unfriendly and\ninclined, he thought, to make fun of him. Night-jars, sounding their mechanical\nrattle, made him think that the wood was full of searching warders, closing in\non him. An owl, swooping noiselessly towards him, brushed his shoulder with its\nwing, making him jump with the horrid certainty that it was a hand; then\nflitted off, moth-like, laughing its low ho! ho! ho; which Toad thought in very\npoor taste. Once he met a fox, who stopped, looked him up and down in a\nsarcastic sort of way, and said, “Hullo, washerwoman! Half a pair of\nsocks and a pillow-case short this week! Mind it doesn’t occur\nagain!” and swaggered off, sniggering. Toad looked about for a stone to\nthrow at him, but could not succeed in finding one, which vexed him more than\nanything. At last, cold, hungry, and tired out, he sought the shelter of a\nhollow tree, where with branches and dead leaves he made himself as comfortable\na bed as he could, and slept soundly till the morning.\n</p>"
