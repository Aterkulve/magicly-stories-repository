  "content": "<p>\nThe Mole had long wanted to make the acquaintance of the Badger. He seemed, by\nall accounts, to be such an important personage and, though rarely visible, to\nmake his unseen influence felt by everybody about the place. But whenever the\nMole mentioned his wish to the Water Rat he always found himself put off.\n“It’s all right,” the Rat would say. “Badger’ll\nturn up some day or other—he’s always turning up—and then\nI’ll introduce you. The best of fellows! But you must not only take him\n<i>as</i> you find him, but <i>when</i> you find him.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Couldn’t you ask him here dinner or something?” said the\nMole.\n</p>\n<p>\n“He wouldn’t come,” replied the Rat simply. “Badger\nhates Society, and invitations, and dinner, and all that sort of thing.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well, then, supposing we go and call on <i>him?</i>” suggested the Mole.\n</p>\n<p>\n“O, I’m sure he wouldn’t like that at <i>all</i>,” said the\nRat, quite alarmed. “He’s so very shy, he’d be sure to be\noffended. I’ve never even ventured to call on him at his own home myself,\nthough I know him so well. Besides, we can’t. It’s quite out of the\nquestion, because he lives in the very middle of the Wild Wood.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well, supposing he does,” said the Mole. “You told me the\nWild Wood was all right, you know.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“O, I know, I know, so it is,” replied the Rat evasively.\n“But I think we won’t go there just now. Not <i>just</i> yet. It’s a\nlong way, and he wouldn’t be at home at this time of year anyhow, and\nhe’ll be coming along some day, if you’ll wait quietly.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Mole had to be content with this. But the Badger never came along, and\nevery day brought its amusements, and it was not till summer was long over, and\ncold and frost and miry ways kept them much indoors, and the swollen river\nraced past outside their windows with a speed that mocked at boating of any\nsort or kind, that he found his thoughts dwelling again with much persistence\non the solitary grey Badger, who lived his own life by himself, in his hole in\nthe middle of the Wild Wood.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the winter time the Rat slept a great deal, retiring early and rising late.\nDuring his short day he sometimes scribbled poetry or did other small domestic\njobs about the house; and, of course, there were always animals dropping in for\na chat, and consequently there was a good deal of story-telling and comparing\nnotes on the past summer and all its doings.\n</p>\n<p>\nSuch a rich chapter it had been, when one came to look back on it all! With\nillustrations so numerous and so very highly coloured! The pageant of the river\nbank had marched steadily along, unfolding itself in scene-pictures that\nsucceeded each other in stately procession. Purple loosestrife arrived early,\nshaking luxuriant tangled locks along the edge of the mirror whence its own\nface laughed back at it. Willow-herb, tender and wistful, like a pink sunset\ncloud, was not slow to follow. Comfrey, the purple hand-in-hand with the white,\ncrept forth to take its place in the line; and at last one morning the\ndiffident and delaying dog-rose stepped delicately on the stage, and one knew,\nas if string-music had announced it in stately chords that strayed into a\ngavotte, that June at last was here. One member of the company was still\nawaited; the shepherd-boy for the nymphs to woo, the knight for whom the ladies\nwaited at the window, the prince that was to kiss the sleeping summer back to\nlife and love. But when meadow-sweet, debonair and odorous in amber jerkin,\nmoved graciously to his place in the group, then the play was ready to begin.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd what a play it had been! Drowsy animals, snug in their holes while wind and\nrain were battering at their doors, recalled still keen mornings, an hour\nbefore sunrise, when the white mist, as yet undispersed, clung closely along\nthe surface of the water; then the shock of the early plunge, the scamper along\nthe bank, and the radiant transformation of earth, air, and water, when\nsuddenly the sun was with them again, and grey was gold and colour was born and\nsprang out of the earth once more. They recalled the languorous siesta of hot\nmid-day, deep in green undergrowth, the sun striking through in tiny golden\nshafts and spots; the boating and bathing of the afternoon, the rambles along\ndusty lanes and through yellow cornfields; and the long, cool evening at last,\nwhen so many threads were gathered up, so many friendships rounded, and so many\nadventures planned for the morrow. There was plenty to talk about on those\nshort winter days when the animals found themselves round the fire; still, the\nMole had a good deal of spare time on his hands, and so one afternoon, when the\nRat in his arm-chair before the blaze was alternately dozing and trying over\nrhymes that wouldn’t fit, he formed the resolution to go out by himself\nand explore the Wild Wood, and perhaps strike up an acquaintance with Mr.\nBadger.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was a cold still afternoon with a hard steely sky overhead, when he slipped\nout of the warm parlour into the open air. The country lay bare and entirely\nleafless around him, and he thought that he had never seen so far and so\nintimately into the insides of things as on that winter day when Nature was\ndeep in her annual slumber and seemed to have kicked the clothes off. Copses,\ndells, quarries and all hidden places, which had been mysterious mines for\nexploration in leafy summer, now exposed themselves and their secrets\npathetically, and seemed to ask him to overlook their shabby poverty for a\nwhile, till they could riot in rich masquerade as before, and trick and entice\nhim with the old deceptions. It was pitiful in a way, and yet\ncheering—even exhilarating. He was glad that he liked the country\nundecorated, hard, and stripped of its finery. He had got down to the bare\nbones of it, and they were fine and strong and simple. He did not want the warm\nclover and the play of seeding grasses; the screens of quickset, the billowy\ndrapery of beech and elm seemed best away; and with great cheerfulness of\nspirit he pushed on towards the Wild Wood, which lay before him low and\nthreatening, like a black reef in some still southern sea.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was nothing to alarm him at first entry. Twigs crackled under his feet,\nlogs tripped him, funguses on stumps resembled caricatures, and startled him\nfor the moment by their likeness to something familiar and far away; but that\nwas all fun, and exciting. It led him on, and he penetrated to where the light\nwas less, and trees crouched nearer and nearer, and holes made ugly mouths at\nhim on either side.\n</p>\n<p>\nEverything was very still now. The dusk advanced on him steadily, rapidly,\ngathering in behind and before; and the light seemed to be draining away like\nflood-water.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen the faces began.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was over his shoulder, and indistinctly, that he first thought he saw a\nface; a little evil wedge-shaped face, looking out at him from a hole. When he\nturned and confronted it, the thing had vanished.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe quickened his pace, telling himself cheerfully not to begin imagining\nthings, or there would be simply no end to it. He passed another hole, and\nanother, and another; and then—yes!—no!—yes! certainly a\nlittle narrow face, with hard eyes, had flashed up for an instant from a hole,\nand was gone. He hesitated—braced himself up for an effort and strode on.\nThen suddenly, and as if it had been so all the time, every hole, far and near,\nand there were hundreds of them, seemed to possess its face, coming and going\nrapidly, all fixing on him glances of malice and hatred: all hard-eyed and evil\nand sharp.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf he could only get away from the holes in the banks, he thought, there would\nbe no more faces. He swung off the path and plunged into the untrodden places\nof the wood.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen the whistling began.\n</p>\n<p>\nVery faint and shrill it was, and far behind him, when first he heard it; but\nsomehow it made him hurry forward. Then, still very faint and shrill, it\nsounded far ahead of him, and made him hesitate and want to go back. As he\nhalted in indecision it broke out on either side, and seemed to be caught up\nand passed on throughout the whole length of the wood to its farthest limit.\nThey were up and alert and ready, evidently, whoever they were! And he—he\nwas alone, and unarmed, and far from any help; and the night was closing in.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen the pattering began.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe thought it was only falling leaves at first, so slight and delicate was the\nsound of it. Then as it grew it took a regular rhythm, and he knew it for\nnothing else but the pat-pat-pat of little feet still a very long way off. Was\nit in front or behind? It seemed to be first one, and then the other, then\nboth. It grew and it multiplied, till from every quarter as he listened\nanxiously, leaning this way and that, it seemed to be closing in on him. As he\nstood still to hearken, a rabbit came running hard towards him through the\ntrees. He waited, expecting it to slacken pace, or to swerve from him into a\ndifferent course. Instead, the animal almost brushed him as it dashed past, his\nface set and hard, his eyes staring. “Get out of this, you fool, get\nout!” the Mole heard him mutter as he swung round a stump and disappeared\ndown a friendly burrow.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe pattering increased till it sounded like sudden hail on the dry leaf-carpet\nspread around him. The whole wood seemed running now, running hard, hunting,\nchasing, closing in round something or—somebody? In panic, he began to\nrun too, aimlessly, he knew not whither. He ran up against things, he fell over\nthings and into things, he darted under things and dodged round things. At last\nhe took refuge in the deep dark hollow of an old beech tree, which offered\nshelter, concealment—perhaps even safety, but who could tell? Anyhow, he\nwas too tired to run any further, and could only snuggle down into the dry\nleaves which had drifted into the hollow and hope he was safe for a time. And\nas he lay there panting and trembling, and listened to the whistlings and the\npatterings outside, he knew it at last, in all its fullness, that dread thing\nwhich other little dwellers in field and hedgerow had encountered here, and\nknown as their darkest moment—that thing which the Rat had vainly tried\nto shield him from—the Terror of the Wild Wood!\n</p>\n<p>\nMeantime the Rat, warm and comfortable, dozed by his fireside. His paper of\nhalf-finished verses slipped from his knee, his head fell back, his mouth\nopened, and he wandered by the verdant banks of dream-rivers. Then a coal\nslipped, the fire crackled and sent up a spurt of flame, and he woke with a\nstart. Remembering what he had been engaged upon, he reached down to the floor\nfor his verses, pored over them for a minute, and then looked round for the\nMole to ask him if he knew a good rhyme for something or other.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the Mole was not there.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe listened for a time. The house seemed very quiet.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen he called “Moly!” several times, and, receiving no answer, got\nup and went out into the hall.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Mole’s cap was missing from its accustomed peg. His goloshes, which\nalways lay by the umbrella-stand, were also gone.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Rat left the house, and carefully examined the muddy surface of the ground\noutside, hoping to find the Mole’s tracks. There they were, sure enough.\nThe goloshes were new, just bought for the winter, and the pimples on their\nsoles were fresh and sharp. He could see the imprints of them in the mud,\nrunning along straight and purposeful, leading direct to the Wild Wood.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Rat looked very grave, and stood in deep thought for a minute or two. Then\nhe re-entered the house, strapped a belt round his waist, shoved a brace of\npistols into it, took up a stout cudgel that stood in a corner of the hall, and\nset off for the Wild Wood at a smart pace.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was already getting towards dusk when he reached the first fringe of trees\nand plunged without hesitation into the wood, looking anxiously on either side\nfor any sign of his friend. Here and there wicked little faces popped out of\nholes, but vanished immediately at sight of the valorous animal, his pistols,\nand the great ugly cudgel in his grasp; and the whistling and pattering, which\nhe had heard quite plainly on his first entry, died away and ceased, and all\nwas very still. He made his way manfully through the length of the wood, to its\nfurthest edge; then, forsaking all paths, he set himself to traverse it,\nlaboriously working over the whole ground, and all the time calling out\ncheerfully, “Moly, Moly, Moly! Where are you? It’s\nme—it’s old Rat!”\n</p>\n<p>\nHe had patiently hunted through the wood for an hour or more, when at last to\nhis joy he heard a little answering cry. Guiding himself by the sound, he made\nhis way through the gathering darkness to the foot of an old beech tree, with a\nhole in it, and from out of the hole came a feeble voice, saying “Ratty!\nIs that really you?”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Rat crept into the hollow, and there he found the Mole, exhausted and still\ntrembling. “O Rat!” he cried, “I’ve been so frightened,\nyou can’t think!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“O, I quite understand,” said the Rat soothingly. “You\nshouldn’t really have gone and done it, Mole. I did my best to keep you\nfrom it. We river-bankers, we hardly ever come here by ourselves. If we have to\ncome, we come in couples, at least; then we’re generally all right.\nBesides, there are a hundred things one has to know, which we understand all\nabout and you don’t, as yet. I mean passwords, and signs, and sayings\nwhich have power and effect, and plants you carry in your pocket, and verses\nyou repeat, and dodges and tricks you practise; all simple enough when you know\nthem, but they’ve got to be known if you’re small, or you’ll\nfind yourself in trouble. Of course if you were Badger or Otter, it would be\nquite another matter.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Surely the brave Mr. Toad wouldn’t mind coming here by himself,\nwould he?” inquired the Mole.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Old Toad?” said the Rat, laughing heartily. “He\nwouldn’t show his face here alone, not for a whole hatful of golden\nguineas, Toad wouldn’t.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Mole was greatly cheered by the sound of the Rat’s careless laughter,\nas well as by the sight of his stick and his gleaming pistols, and he stopped\nshivering and began to feel bolder and more himself again.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Now then,” said the Rat presently, “we really must pull\nourselves together and make a start for home while there’s still a little\nlight left. It will never do to spend the night here, you understand. Too cold,\nfor one thing.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Dear Ratty,” said the poor Mole, “I’m dreadfully\nsorry, but I’m simply dead beat and that’s a solid fact. You <i>must</i>\nlet me rest here a while longer, and get my strength back, if I’m to get\nhome at all.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“O, all right,” said the good-natured Rat, “rest away.\nIt’s pretty nearly pitch dark now, anyhow; and there ought to be a bit of\na moon later.”\n</p>\n<p>\nSo the Mole got well into the dry leaves and stretched himself out, and\npresently dropped off into sleep, though of a broken and troubled sort; while\nthe Rat covered himself up, too, as best he might, for warmth, and lay\npatiently waiting, with a pistol in his paw.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen at last the Mole woke up, much refreshed and in his usual spirits, the Rat\nsaid, “Now then! I’ll just take a look outside and see if\neverything’s quiet, and then we really must be off.”\n</p>\n<p>\nHe went to the entrance of their retreat and put his head out. Then the Mole\nheard him saying quietly to himself, “Hullo! hullo!\nhere—is—a—go!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“What’s up, Ratty?” asked the Mole.\n</p>\n<p>\n“<i>Snow</i> is up,” replied the Rat briefly; “or rather, <i>down</i>.\nIt’s snowing hard.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Mole came and crouched beside him, and, looking out, saw the wood that had\nbeen so dreadful to him in quite a changed aspect. Holes, hollows, pools,\npitfalls, and other black menaces to the wayfarer were vanishing fast, and a\ngleaming carpet of faery was springing up everywhere, that looked too delicate\nto be trodden upon by rough feet. A fine powder filled the air and caressed the\ncheek with a tingle in its touch, and the black boles of the trees showed up in\na light that seemed to come from below.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well, well, it can’t be helped,” said the Rat, after\npondering. “We must make a start, and take our chance, I suppose. The\nworst of it is, I don’t exactly know where we are. And now this snow\nmakes everything look so very different.”\n</p>\n<p>\nIt did indeed. The Mole would not have known that it was the same wood.\nHowever, they set out bravely, and took the line that seemed most promising,\nholding on to each other and pretending with invincible cheerfulness that they\nrecognized an old friend in every fresh tree that grimly and silently greeted\nthem, or saw openings, gaps, or paths with a familiar turn in them, in the\nmonotony of white space and black tree-trunks that refused to vary.\n</p>\n<p>\nAn hour or two later—they had lost all count of time—they pulled\nup, dispirited, weary, and hopelessly at sea, and sat down on a fallen\ntree-trunk to recover their breath and consider what was to be done. They were\naching with fatigue and bruised with tumbles; they had fallen into several\nholes and got wet through; the snow was getting so deep that they could hardly\ndrag their little legs through it, and the trees were thicker and more like\neach other than ever. There seemed to be no end to this wood, and no beginning,\nand no difference in it, and, worst of all, no way out.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We can’t sit here very long,” said the Rat. “We shall\nhave to make another push for it, and do something or other. The cold is too\nawful for anything, and the snow will soon be too deep for us to wade\nthrough.” He peered about him and considered. “Look here,” he\nwent on, “this is what occurs to me. There’s a sort of dell down\nhere in front of us, where the ground seems all hilly and humpy and hummocky.\nWe’ll make our way down into that, and try and find some sort of shelter,\na cave or hole with a dry floor to it, out of the snow and the wind, and there\nwe’ll have a good rest before we try again, for we’re both of us\npretty dead beat. Besides, the snow may leave off, or something may turn\nup.”\n</p>\n<p>\nSo once more they got on their feet, and struggled down into the dell, where\nthey hunted about for a cave or some corner that was dry and a protection from\nthe keen wind and the whirling snow. They were investigating one of the\nhummocky bits the Rat had spoken of, when suddenly the Mole tripped up and fell\nforward on his face with a squeal.\n</p>\n<p>\n“O my leg!” he cried. “O my poor shin!” and he sat up\non the snow and nursed his leg in both his front paws.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Poor old Mole!” said the Rat kindly.\n</p>\n<p>\n“You don’t seem to be having much luck to-day, do you? Let’s\nhave a look at the leg. Yes,” he went on, going down on his knees to\nlook, “you’ve cut your shin, sure enough. Wait till I get at my\nhandkerchief, and I’ll tie it up for you.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I must have tripped over a hidden branch or a stump,” said the\nMole miserably. “O, my! O, my!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“It’s a very clean cut,” said the Rat, examining it again\nattentively. “That was never done by a branch or a stump. Looks as if it\nwas made by a sharp edge of something in metal. Funny!” He pondered\nawhile, and examined the humps and slopes that surrounded them.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well, never mind what done it,” said the Mole, forgetting his\ngrammar in his pain. “It hurts just the same, whatever done it.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the Rat, after carefully tying up the leg with his handkerchief, had left\nhim and was busy scraping in the snow. He scratched and shovelled and explored,\nall four legs working busily, while the Mole waited impatiently, remarking at\nintervals, “O, <i>come</i> on, Rat!”\n</p>\n<p>\nSuddenly the Rat cried “Hooray!” and then\n“Hooray-oo-ray-oo-ray-oo-ray!” and fell to executing a feeble jig\nin the snow.\n</p>\n<p>\n“What <i>have</i> you found, Ratty?” asked the Mole, still nursing his\nleg.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Come and see!” said the delighted Rat, as he jigged on.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Mole hobbled up to the spot and had a good look.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well,” he said at last, slowly, “I SEE it right enough. Seen\nthe same sort of thing before, lots of times. Familiar object, I call it. A\ndoor-scraper! Well, what of it? Why dance jigs around a door-scraper?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“But don’t you see what it <i>means</i>, you—you dull-witted\nanimal?” cried the Rat impatiently.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Of course I see what it means,” replied the Mole. “It simply\nmeans that some VERY careless and forgetful person has left his door-scraper\nlying about in the middle of the Wild Wood, <i>just</i> where it’s <i>sure</i> to trip\n<i>everybody</i> up. Very thoughtless of him, I call it. When I get home I shall go\nand complain about it to—to somebody or other, see if I\ndon’t!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“O, dear! O, dear!” cried the Rat, in despair at his obtuseness.\n“Here, stop arguing and come and scrape!” And he set to work again\nand made the snow fly in all directions around him.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter some further toil his efforts were rewarded, and a very shabby door-mat\nlay exposed to view.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There, what did I tell you?” exclaimed the Rat in great triumph.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Absolutely nothing whatever,” replied the Mole, with perfect\ntruthfulness. “Well now,” he went on, “you seem to have found\nanother piece of domestic litter, done for and thrown away, and I suppose\nyou’re perfectly happy. Better go ahead and dance your jig round that if\nyou’ve got to, and get it over, and then perhaps we can go on and not\nwaste any more time over rubbish-heaps. Can we EAT a doormat? or sleep under a\ndoor-mat? Or sit on a door-mat and sledge home over the snow on it, you\nexasperating rodent?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Do—you—mean—to—say,” cried the excited\nRat, “that this door-mat doesn’t <i>tell</i> you anything?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Really, Rat,” said the Mole, quite pettishly, “I think\nwe’d had enough of this folly. Who ever heard of a door-mat <i>telling</i>\nanyone anything? They simply don’t do it. They are not that sort at all.\nDoor-mats know their place.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Now look here, you—you thick-headed beast,” replied the Rat,\nreally angry, “this must stop. Not another word, but scrape—scrape\nand scratch and dig and hunt round, especially on the sides of the hummocks, if\nyou want to sleep dry and warm to-night, for it’s our last chance!”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Rat attacked a snow-bank beside them with ardour, probing with his cudgel\neverywhere and then digging with fury; and the Mole scraped busily too, more to\noblige the Rat than for any other reason, for his opinion was that his friend\nwas getting light-headed.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome ten minutes’ hard work, and the point of the Rat’s cudgel\nstruck something that sounded hollow. He worked till he could get a paw through\nand feel; then called the Mole to come and help him. Hard at it went the two\nanimals, till at last the result of their labours stood full in view of the\nastonished and hitherto incredulous Mole.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the side of what had seemed to be a snow-bank stood a solid-looking little\ndoor, painted a dark green. An iron bell-pull hung by the side, and below it,\non a small brass plate, neatly engraved in square capital letters, they could\nread by the aid of moonlight\n</p>\n<p class=\"center\">\nMR. BADGER.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Mole fell backwards on the snow from sheer surprise and delight.\n“Rat!” he cried in penitence, “you’re a wonder! A real\nwonder, that’s what you are. I see it all now! You argued it out, step by\nstep, in that wise head of yours, from the very moment that I fell and cut my\nshin, and you looked at the cut, and at once your majestic mind said to itself,\n‘Door-scraper!’ And then you turned to and found the very\ndoor-scraper that done it! Did you stop there? No. Some people would have been\nquite satisfied; but not you. Your intellect went on working. ‘Let me\nonly just find a door-mat,’ says you to yourself, ‘and my theory is\nproved!’ And of course you found your door-mat. You’re so clever, I\nbelieve you could find anything you liked. ‘Now,’ says you,\n‘that door exists, as plain as if I saw it. There’s nothing else\nremains to be done but to find it!’ Well, I’ve read about that sort\nof thing in books, but I’ve never come across it before in real life. You\nought to go where you’ll be properly appreciated. You’re simply\nwasted here, among us fellows. If I only had your head,\nRatty——”\n</p>\n<p>\n“But as you haven’t,” interrupted the Rat, rather unkindly,\n“I suppose you’re going to sit on the snow all night and <i>talk?</i> Get\nup at once and hang on to that bell-pull you see there, and ring hard, as hard\nas you can, while I hammer!”\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile the Rat attacked the door with his stick, the Mole sprang up at the\nbell-pull, clutched it and swung there, both feet well off the ground, and from\nquite a long way off they could faintly hear a deep-toned bell respond.\n</p>"
