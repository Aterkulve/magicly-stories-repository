  "content": "<p>\n“Your majesty shouldn’t purr so loud,” Alice said, rubbing\nher eyes, and addressing the kitten, respectfully, yet with some severity.\n“You woke me out of oh! such a nice dream! And you’ve been along\nwith me, Kitty—all through the Looking-Glass world. Did you know it,\ndear?”\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (Alice had once made the remark)\nthat, whatever you say to them, they <i>always</i> purr. “If they would\nonly purr for ‘yes’ and mew for ‘no,’ or any rule of\nthat sort,” she had said, “so that one could keep up a\nconversation! But how <i>can</i> you talk with a person if they always say the\nsame thing?”\n</p>\n<p>\nOn this occasion the kitten only purred: and it was impossible to guess whether\nit meant “yes” or “no.”\n</p>\n<p>\nSo Alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the Red\nQueen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug, and put the kitten\nand the Queen to look at each other. “Now, Kitty!” she cried,\nclapping her hands triumphantly. “Confess that was what you turned\ninto!”\n</p>\n<p>\n(“But it wouldn’t look at it,” she said, when she was\nexplaining the thing afterwards to her sister: “it turned away its head,\nand pretended not to see it: but it looked a <i>little</i> ashamed of itself,\nso I think it <i>must</i> have been the Red Queen.”)\n</p>\n<p>\n“Sit up a little more stiffly, dear!” Alice cried with a merry\nlaugh. “And curtsey while you’re thinking what to—what to\npurr. It saves time, remember!” And she caught it up and gave it one\nlittle kiss, “just in honour of having been a Red Queen.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Snowdrop, my pet!” she went on, looking over her shoulder at the\nWhite Kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet, “when\n<i>will</i> Dinah have finished with your White Majesty, I wonder? That must be\nthe reason you were so untidy in my dream—Dinah! do you know that\nyou’re scrubbing a White Queen? Really, it’s most disrespectful of\nyou!\n</p>\n<p>\n“And what did <i>Dinah</i> turn to, I wonder?” she prattled on, as\nshe settled comfortably down, with one elbow in the rug, and her chin in her\nhand, to watch the kittens. “Tell me, Dinah, did you turn to Humpty\nDumpty? I <i>think</i> you did—however, you’d better not mention it\nto your friends just yet, for I’m not sure.\n</p>\n<p>\n“By the way, Kitty, if only you’d been really with me in my dream,\nthere was one thing you <i>would</i> have enjoyed—I had such a quantity\nof poetry said to me, all about fishes! To-morrow morning you shall have a real\ntreat. All the time you’re eating your breakfast, I’ll repeat\n‘The Walrus and the Carpenter’ to you; and then you can make\nbelieve it’s oysters, dear!\n</p>\n<p>\n“Now, Kitty, let’s consider who it was that dreamed it all. This is\na serious question, my dear, and you should <i>not</i> go on licking your paw\nlike that—as if Dinah hadn’t washed you this morning! You see,\nKitty, it <i>must</i> have been either me or the Red King. He was part of my\ndream, of course—but then I was part of his dream, too! <i>Was</i> it the\nRed King, Kitty? You were his wife, my dear, so you ought to know—Oh,\nKitty, <i>do</i> help to settle it! I’m sure your paw can wait!”\nBut the provoking kitten only began on the other paw, and pretended it\nhadn’t heard the question.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhich do <i>you</i> think it was?\n</p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\nA boat beneath a sunny sky,<br/>\nLingering onward dreamily<br/>\nIn an evening of July—<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren three that nestle near,<br/>\nEager eye and willing ear,<br/>\nPleased a simple tale to hear—<br/>\n<br/>\nLong has paled that sunny sky:<br/>\nEchoes fade and memories die.<br/>\nAutumn frosts have slain July.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill she haunts me, phantomwise,<br/>\nAlice moving under skies<br/>\nNever seen by waking eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren yet, the tale to hear,<br/>\nEager eye and willing ear,<br/>\nLovingly shall nestle near.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a Wonderland they lie,<br/>\nDreaming as the days go by,<br/>\nDreaming as the summers die:<br/>\n<br/>\nEver drifting down the stream—<br/>\nLingering in the golden gleam—<br/>\nLife, what is it but a dream?\n</p>\n<p class=\"center\">\nTHE END\n</p>"
