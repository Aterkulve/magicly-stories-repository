  "content": "<p>\nOf course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of the country she\nwas going to travel through. “It’s something very like learning\ngeography,” thought Alice, as she stood on tiptoe in hopes of being able\nto see a little further. “Principal rivers—there <i>are</i> none.\nPrincipal mountains—I’m on the only one, but I don’t think\nit’s got any name. Principal towns—why, what <i>are</i> those\ncreatures, making honey down there? They can’t be bees—nobody ever\nsaw bees a mile off, you know—” and for some time she stood silent,\nwatching one of them that was bustling about among the flowers, poking its\nproboscis into them, “just as if it was a regular bee,” thought\nAlice.\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, this was anything but a regular bee: in fact it was an\nelephant—as Alice soon found out, though the idea quite took her breath\naway at first. “And what enormous flowers they must be!” was her\nnext idea. “Something like cottages with the roofs taken off, and stalks\nput to them—and what quantities of honey they must make! I think\nI’ll go down and—no, I won’t <i>just</i> yet,” she went\non, checking herself just as she was beginning to run down the hill, and trying\nto find some excuse for turning shy so suddenly. “It’ll never do to\ngo down among them without a good long branch to brush them away—and what\nfun it’ll be when they ask me how I like my walk. I shall\nsay—‘Oh, I like it well enough—’” (here came the\nfavourite little toss of the head), “‘only it was so dusty and hot,\nand the elephants did tease so!’”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I think I’ll go down the other way,” she said after a pause:\n“and perhaps I may visit the elephants later on. Besides, I do so want to\nget into the Third Square!”\n</p>\n<p>\nSo with this excuse she ran down the hill and jumped over the first of the six\nlittle brooks.\n</p>\n<p class=\"asterism\">\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n<br/>\n    *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n<br/>\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n“Tickets, please!” said the Guard, putting his head in at the\nwindow. In a moment everybody was holding out a ticket: they were about the\nsame size as the people, and quite seemed to fill the carriage.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Now then! Show your ticket, child!” the Guard went on, looking\nangrily at Alice. And a great many voices all said together (“like the\nchorus of a song,” thought Alice), “Don’t keep him waiting,\nchild! Why, his time is worth a thousand pounds a minute!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’m afraid I haven’t got one,” Alice said in a\nfrightened tone: “there wasn’t a ticket-office where I came\nfrom.” And again the chorus of voices went on. “There wasn’t\nroom for one where she came from. The land there is worth a thousand pounds an\ninch!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Don’t make excuses,” said the Guard: “you should have\nbought one from the engine-driver.” And once more the chorus of voices\nwent on with “The man that drives the engine. Why, the smoke alone is\nworth a thousand pounds a puff!”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice thought to herself, “Then there’s no use in speaking.”\nThe voices didn’t join in this time, as she hadn’t spoken, but to\nher great surprise, they all <i>thought</i> in chorus (I hope you understand\nwhat <i>thinking in chorus</i> means—for I must confess that <i>I</i>\ndon’t), “Better say nothing at all. Language is worth a thousand\npounds a word!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I shall dream about a thousand pounds tonight, I know I shall!”\nthought Alice.\n</p>\n<p>\nAll this time the Guard was looking at her, first through a telescope, then\nthrough a microscope, and then through an opera-glass. At last he said,\n“You’re travelling the wrong way,” and shut up the window and\nwent away.\n</p>\n<p>\n“So young a child,” said the gentleman sitting opposite to her (he\nwas dressed in white paper), “ought to know which way she’s going,\neven if she doesn’t know her own name!”\n</p>\n<p>\nA Goat, that was sitting next to the gentleman in white, shut his eyes and said\nin a loud voice, “She ought to know her way to the ticket-office, even if\nshe doesn’t know her alphabet!”\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was a Beetle sitting next to the Goat (it was a very queer carriage-full\nof passengers altogether), and, as the rule seemed to be that they should all\nspeak in turn, <i>he</i> went on with “She’ll have to go back from\nhere as luggage!”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice couldn’t see who was sitting beyond the Beetle, but a hoarse voice\nspoke next. “Change engines—” it said, and was obliged to\nleave off.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It sounds like a horse,” Alice thought to herself. And an\nextremely small voice, close to her ear, said, “You might make a joke on\nthat—something about ‘horse’ and ‘hoarse,’ you\nknow.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThen a very gentle voice in the distance said, “She must be labelled\n‘Lass, with care,’ you know—”\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd after that other voices went on (“What a number of people there are\nin the carriage!” thought Alice), saying, “She must go by post, as\nshe’s got a head on her—” “She must be sent as a\nmessage by the telegraph—” “She must draw the train herself\nthe rest of the way—” and so on.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forwards and whispered in her\near, “Never mind what they all say, my dear, but take a return-ticket\nevery time the train stops.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Indeed I shan’t!” Alice said rather impatiently. “I\ndon’t belong to this railway journey at all—I was in a wood just\nnow—and I wish I could get back there.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“You might make a joke on <i>that</i>,” said the little voice close\nto her ear: “something about ‘you <i>would</i> if you could,’\nyou know.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Don’t tease so,” said Alice, looking about in vain to see\nwhere the voice came from; “if you’re so anxious to have a joke\nmade, why don’t you make one yourself?”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe little voice sighed deeply: it was <i>very</i> unhappy, evidently, and\nAlice would have said something pitying to comfort it, “If it would only\nsigh like other people!” she thought. But this was such a wonderfully\nsmall sigh, that she wouldn’t have heard it at all, if it hadn’t\ncome <i>quite</i> close to her ear. The consequence of this was that it tickled\nher ear very much, and quite took off her thoughts from the unhappiness of the\npoor little creature.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I know you are a friend,” the little voice went on; “a dear\nfriend, and an old friend. And you won’t hurt me, though I <i>am</i> an\ninsect.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“What kind of insect?” Alice inquired a little anxiously. What she\nreally wanted to know was, whether it could sting or not, but she thought this\nwouldn’t be quite a civil question to ask.\n</p>\n<p>\n“What, then you don’t—” the little voice began, when it\nwas drowned by a shrill scream from the engine, and everybody jumped up in\nalarm, Alice among the rest.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Horse, who had put his head out of the window, quietly drew it in and said,\n“It’s only a brook we have to jump over.” Everybody seemed\nsatisfied with this, though Alice felt a little nervous at the idea of trains\njumping at all. “However, it’ll take us into the Fourth Square,\nthat’s some comfort!” she said to herself. In another moment she\nfelt the carriage rise straight up into the air, and in her fright she caught\nat the thing nearest to her hand, which happened to be the Goat’s beard.\n</p>\n<p class=\"asterism\">\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n<br/>\n    *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n<br/>\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the beard seemed to melt away as she touched it, and she found herself\nsitting quietly under a tree—while the Gnat (for that was the insect she\nhad been talking to) was balancing itself on a twig just over her head, and\nfanning her with its wings.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt certainly was a <i>very</i> large Gnat: “about the size of a\nchicken,” Alice thought. Still, she couldn’t feel nervous with it,\nafter they had been talking together so long.\n</p>\n<p>\n“—then you don’t like all insects?” the Gnat went on,\nas quietly as if nothing had happened.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I like them when they can talk,” Alice said. “None of them\never talk, where <i>I</i> come from.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“What sort of insects do you rejoice in, where <i>you</i> come\nfrom?” the Gnat inquired.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I don’t <i>rejoice</i> in insects at all,” Alice explained,\n“because I’m rather afraid of them—at least the large kinds.\nBut I can tell you the names of some of them.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Of course they answer to their names?” the Gnat remarked\ncarelessly.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I never knew them to do it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“What’s the use of their having names,” the Gnat said,\n“if they won’t answer to them?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“No use to <i>them</i>,” said Alice; “but it’s useful\nto the people who name them, I suppose. If not, why do things have names at\nall?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I can’t say,” the Gnat replied. “Further on, in the\nwood down there, they’ve got no names—however, go on with your list\nof insects: you’re wasting time.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well, there’s the Horse-fly,” Alice began, counting off the\nnames on her fingers.\n</p>\n<p>\n“All right,” said the Gnat: “half way up that bush,\nyou’ll see a Rocking-horse-fly, if you look. It’s made entirely of\nwood, and gets about by swinging itself from branch to branch.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“What does it live on?” Alice asked, with great curiosity.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Sap and sawdust,” said the Gnat. “Go on with the\nlist.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice looked up at the Rocking-horse-fly with great interest, and made up her\nmind that it must have been just repainted, it looked so bright and sticky; and\nthen she went on.\n</p>\n<p>\n“And there’s the Dragon-fly.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Look on the branch above your head,” said the Gnat, “and\nthere you’ll find a snap-dragon-fly. Its body is made of plum-pudding,\nits wings of holly-leaves, and its head is a raisin burning in brandy.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“And what does it live on?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Frumenty and mince pie,” the Gnat replied; “and it makes its\nnest in a Christmas box.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“And then there’s the Butterfly,” Alice went on, after she\nhad taken a good look at the insect with its head on fire, and had thought to\nherself, “I wonder if that’s the reason insects are so fond of\nflying into candles—because they want to turn into\nSnap-dragon-flies!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Crawling at your feet,” said the Gnat (Alice drew her feet back in\nsome alarm), “you may observe a Bread-and-Butterfly. Its wings are thin\nslices of Bread-and-butter, its body is a crust, and its head is a lump of\nsugar.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“And what does <i>it</i> live on?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Weak tea with cream in it.”\n</p>\n<p>\nA new difficulty came into Alice’s head. “Supposing it\ncouldn’t find any?” she suggested.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Then it would die, of course.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“But that must happen very often,” Alice remarked thoughtfully.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It always happens,” said the Gnat.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter this, Alice was silent for a minute or two, pondering. The Gnat amused\nitself meanwhile by humming round and round her head: at last it settled again\nand remarked, “I suppose you don’t want to lose your name?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“No, indeed,” Alice said, a little anxiously.\n</p>\n<p>\n“And yet I don’t know,” the Gnat went on in a careless tone:\n“only think how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home\nwithout it! For instance, if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons,\nshe would call out ‘come here—,’ and there she would have to\nleave off, because there wouldn’t be any name for her to call, and of\ncourse you wouldn’t have to go, you know.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“That would never do, I’m sure,” said Alice: “the\ngoverness would never think of excusing me lessons for that. If she\ncouldn’t remember my name, she’d call me ‘Miss!’ as the\nservants do.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well, if she said ‘Miss,’ and didn’t say anything\nmore,” the Gnat remarked, “of course you’d miss your lessons.\nThat’s a joke. I wish <i>you</i> had made it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Why do you wish <i>I</i> had made it?” Alice asked.\n“It’s a very bad one.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the Gnat only sighed deeply, while two large tears came rolling down its\ncheeks.\n</p>\n<p>\n“You shouldn’t make jokes,” Alice said, “if it makes\nyou so unhappy.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThen came another of those melancholy little sighs, and this time the poor Gnat\nreally seemed to have sighed itself away, for, when Alice looked up, there was\nnothing whatever to be seen on the twig, and, as she was getting quite chilly\nwith sitting still so long, she got up and walked on.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe very soon came to an open field, with a wood on the other side of it: it\nlooked much darker than the last wood, and Alice felt a <i>little</i> timid\nabout going into it. However, on second thoughts, she made up her mind to go\non: “for I certainly won’t go <i>back</i>,” she thought to\nherself, and this was the only way to the Eighth Square.\n</p>\n<p>\n“This must be the wood,” she said thoughtfully to herself,\n“where things have no names. I wonder what’ll become of <i>my</i>\nname when I go in? I shouldn’t like to lose it at all—because\nthey’d have to give me another, and it would be almost certain to be an\nugly one. But then the fun would be trying to find the creature that had got my\nold name! That’s just like the advertisements, you know, when people lose\ndogs—‘<i>answers to the name of “Dash:” had on a brass\ncollar</i>’—just fancy calling everything you met\n‘Alice,’ till one of them answered! Only they wouldn’t answer\nat all, if they were wise.”\n</p>\n<p>\nShe was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood: it looked very cool\nand shady. “Well, at any rate it’s a great comfort,” she said\nas she stepped under the trees, “after being so hot, to get into\nthe—into <i>what</i>?” she went on, rather surprised at not being\nable to think of the word. “I mean to get under the—under\nthe—under <i>this</i>, you know!” putting her hand on the trunk of\nthe tree. “What <i>does</i> it call itself, I wonder? I do believe\nit’s got no name—why, to be sure it hasn’t!”\n</p>\n<p>\nShe stood silent for a minute, thinking: then she suddenly began again.\n“Then it really <i>has</i> happened, after all! And now, who am I? I\n<i>will</i> remember, if I can! I’m determined to do it!” But being\ndetermined didn’t help much, and all she could say, after a great deal of\npuzzling, was, “L, I <i>know</i> it begins with L!”\n</p>\n<p>\nJust then a Fawn came wandering by: it looked at Alice with its large gentle\neyes, but didn’t seem at all frightened. “Here then! Here\nthen!” Alice said, as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it; but\nit only started back a little, and then stood looking at her again.\n</p>\n<p>\n“What do you call yourself?” the Fawn said at last. Such a soft\nsweet voice it had!\n</p>\n<p>\n“I wish I knew!” thought poor Alice. She answered, rather sadly,\n“Nothing, just now.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Think again,” it said: “that won’t do.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice thought, but nothing came of it. “Please, would you tell me what\n<i>you</i> call yourself?” she said timidly. “I think that might\nhelp a little.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’ll tell you, if you’ll move a little further on,”\nthe Fawn said. “I can’t remember here.”\n</p>\n<p>\nSo they walked on together though the wood, Alice with her arms clasped\nlovingly round the soft neck of the Fawn, till they came out into another open\nfield, and here the Fawn gave a sudden bound into the air, and shook itself\nfree from Alice’s arms. “I’m a Fawn!” it cried out in a\nvoice of delight, “and, dear me! you’re a human child!” A\nsudden look of alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes, and in another moment\nit had darted away at full speed.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice stood looking after it, almost ready to cry with vexation at having lost\nher dear little fellow-traveller so suddenly. “However, I know my name\nnow.” she said, “that’s <i>some</i> comfort.\nAlice—Alice—I won’t forget it again. And now, which of these\nfinger-posts ought I to follow, I wonder?”\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was not a very difficult question to answer, as there was only one road\nthrough the wood, and the two finger-posts both pointed along it.\n“I’ll settle it,” Alice said to herself, “when the road\ndivides and they point different ways.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBut this did not seem likely to happen. She went on and on, a long way, but\nwherever the road divided there were sure to be two finger-posts pointing the\nsame way, one marked “TO TWEEDLEDUM’S HOUSE” and the other\n“TO THE HOUSE OF TWEEDLEDEE.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I do believe,” said Alice at last, “that they live in the\nsame house! I wonder I never thought of that before—But I can’t\nstay there long. I’ll just call and say ‘how d’you do?’\nand ask them the way out of the wood. If I could only get to the Eighth Square\nbefore it gets dark!” So she wandered on, talking to herself as she went,\ntill, on turning a sharp corner, she came upon two fat little men, so suddenly\nthat she could not help starting back, but in another moment she recovered\nherself, feeling sure that they must be.\n</p>"
