  "content": "<p>\nAfter a while the noise seemed gradually to die away, till all was dead\nsilence, and Alice lifted up her head in some alarm. There was no one to be\nseen, and her first thought was that she must have been dreaming about the Lion\nand the Unicorn and those queer Anglo-Saxon Messengers. However, there was the\ngreat dish still lying at her feet, on which she had tried to cut the\nplum-cake, “So I wasn’t dreaming, after all,” she said to\nherself, “unless—unless we’re all part of the same dream.\nOnly I do hope it’s <i>my</i> dream, and not the Red King’s! I\ndon’t like belonging to another person’s dream,” she went on\nin a rather complaining tone: “I’ve a great mind to go and wake\nhim, and see what happens!”\n</p>\n<p>\nAt this moment her thoughts were interrupted by a loud shouting of “Ahoy!\nAhoy! Check!” and a Knight dressed in crimson armour came galloping down\nupon her, brandishing a great club. Just as he reached her, the horse stopped\nsuddenly: “You’re my prisoner!” the Knight cried, as he\ntumbled off his horse.\n</p>\n<p>\nStartled as she was, Alice was more frightened for him than for herself at the\nmoment, and watched him with some anxiety as he mounted again. As soon as he\nwas comfortably in the saddle, he began once more “You’re\nmy—” but here another voice broke in “Ahoy! Ahoy!\nCheck!” and Alice looked round in some surprise for the new enemy.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis time it was a White Knight. He drew up at Alice’s side, and tumbled\noff his horse just as the Red Knight had done: then he got on again, and the\ntwo Knights sat and looked at each other for some time without speaking. Alice\nlooked from one to the other in some bewilderment.\n</p>\n<p>\n“She’s <i>my</i> prisoner, you know!” the Red Knight said at\nlast.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Yes, but then <i>I</i> came and rescued her!” the White Knight\nreplied.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well, we must fight for her, then,” said the Red Knight, as he\ntook up his helmet (which hung from the saddle, and was something the shape of\na horse’s head), and put it on.\n</p>\n<p>\n“You will observe the Rules of Battle, of course?” the White Knight\nremarked, putting on his helmet too.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I always do,” said the Red Knight, and they began banging away at\neach other with such fury that Alice got behind a tree to be out of the way of\nthe blows.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I wonder, now, what the Rules of Battle are,” she said to herself,\nas she watched the fight, timidly peeping out from her hiding-place: “one\nRule seems to be, that if one Knight hits the other, he knocks him off his\nhorse, and if he misses, he tumbles off himself—and another Rule seems to\nbe that they hold their clubs with their arms, as if they were Punch and\nJudy—What a noise they make when they tumble! Just like a whole set of\nfire-irons falling into the fender! And how quiet the horses are! They let them\nget on and off them just as if they were tables!”\n</p>\n<p>\nAnother Rule of Battle, that Alice had not noticed, seemed to be that they\nalways fell on their heads, and the battle ended with their both falling off in\nthis way, side by side: when they got up again, they shook hands, and then the\nRed Knight mounted and galloped off.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It was a glorious victory, wasn’t it?” said the White\nKnight, as he came up panting.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I don’t know,” Alice said doubtfully. “I don’t\nwant to be anybody’s prisoner. I want to be a Queen.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“So you will, when you’ve crossed the next brook,” said the\nWhite Knight. “I’ll see you safe to the end of the wood—and\nthen I must go back, you know. That’s the end of my move.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Thank you very much,” said Alice. “May I help you off with\nyour helmet?” It was evidently more than he could manage by himself;\nhowever, she managed to shake him out of it at last.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Now one can breathe more easily,” said the Knight, putting back\nhis shaggy hair with both hands, and turning his gentle face and large mild\neyes to Alice. She thought she had never seen such a strange-looking soldier in\nall her life.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe was dressed in tin armour, which seemed to fit him very badly, and he had a\nqueer-shaped little deal box fastened across his shoulder, upside-down, and\nwith the lid hanging open. Alice looked at it with great curiosity.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I see you’re admiring my little box.” the Knight said in a\nfriendly tone. “It’s my own invention—to keep clothes and\nsandwiches in. You see I carry it upside-down, so that the rain can’t get\nin.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“But the things can get <i>out</i>,” Alice gently remarked.\n“Do you know the lid’s open?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I didn’t know it,” the Knight said, a shade of vexation\npassing over his face. “Then all the things must have fallen out! And the\nbox is no use without them.” He unfastened it as he spoke, and was just\ngoing to throw it into the bushes, when a sudden thought seemed to strike him,\nand he hung it carefully on a tree. “Can you guess why I did that?”\nhe said to Alice.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice shook her head.\n</p>\n<p>\n“In hopes some bees may make a nest in it—then I should get the\nhoney.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“But you’ve got a bee-hive—or something like\none—fastened to the saddle,” said Alice.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Yes, it’s a very good bee-hive,” the Knight said in a\ndiscontented tone, “one of the best kind. But not a single bee has come\nnear it yet. And the other thing is a mouse-trap. I suppose the mice keep the\nbees out—or the bees keep the mice out, I don’t know which.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was wondering what the mouse-trap was for,” said Alice.\n“It isn’t very likely there would be any mice on the horse’s\nback.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Not very likely, perhaps,” said the Knight: “but if they\n<i>do</i> come, I don’t choose to have them running all about.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“You see,” he went on after a pause, “it’s as well to\nbe provided for <i>everything</i>. That’s the reason the horse has all\nthose anklets round his feet.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“But what are they for?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\n</p>\n<p>\n“To guard against the bites of sharks,” the Knight replied.\n“It’s an invention of my own. And now help me on. I’ll go\nwith you to the end of the wood—What’s the dish for?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“It’s meant for plum-cake,” said Alice.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We’d better take it with us,” the Knight said.\n“It’ll come in handy if we find any plum-cake. Help me to get it\ninto this bag.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThis took a very long time to manage, though Alice held the bag open very\ncarefully, because the Knight was so <i>very</i> awkward in putting in the\ndish: the first two or three times that he tried he fell in himself instead.\n“It’s rather a tight fit, you see,” he said, as they got it\nin a last; “There are so many candlesticks in the bag.” And he hung\nit to the saddle, which was already loaded with bunches of carrots, and\nfire-irons, and many other things.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I hope you’ve got your hair well fastened on?” he continued,\nas they set off.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Only in the usual way,” Alice said, smiling.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That’s hardly enough,” he said, anxiously. “You see\nthe wind is so <i>very</i> strong here. It’s as strong as soup.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown\noff?” Alice enquired.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Not yet,” said the Knight. “But I’ve got a plan for\nkeeping it from <i>falling</i> off.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I should like to hear it, very much.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“First you take an upright stick,” said the Knight. “Then you\nmake your hair creep up it, like a fruit-tree. Now the reason hair falls off is\nbecause it hangs <i>down</i>—things never fall <i>upwards</i>, you know.\nIt’s a plan of my own invention. You may try it if you like.”\n</p>\n<p>\nIt didn’t sound a comfortable plan, Alice thought, and for a few minutes\nshe walked on in silence, puzzling over the idea, and every now and then\nstopping to help the poor Knight, who certainly was <i>not</i> a good rider.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhenever the horse stopped (which it did very often), he fell off in front; and\nwhenever it went on again (which it generally did rather suddenly), he fell off\nbehind. Otherwise he kept on pretty well, except that he had a habit of now and\nthen falling off sideways; and as he generally did this on the side on which\nAlice was walking, she soon found that it was the best plan not to walk\n<i>quite</i> close to the horse.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’m afraid you’ve not had much practice in riding,”\nshe ventured to say, as she was helping him up from his fifth tumble.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Knight looked very much surprised, and a little offended at the remark.\n“What makes you say that?” he asked, as he scrambled back into the\nsaddle, keeping hold of Alice’s hair with one hand, to save himself from\nfalling over on the other side.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Because people don’t fall off quite so often, when they’ve\nhad much practice.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’ve had plenty of practice,” the Knight said very gravely:\n“plenty of practice!”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice could think of nothing better to say than “Indeed?” but she\nsaid it as heartily as she could. They went on a little way in silence after\nthis, the Knight with his eyes shut, muttering to himself, and Alice watching\nanxiously for the next tumble.\n</p>\n<p>\n“The great art of riding,” the Knight suddenly began in a loud\nvoice, waving his right arm as he spoke, “is to keep—” Here\nthe sentence ended as suddenly as it had begun, as the Knight fell heavily on\nthe top of his head exactly in the path where Alice was walking. She was quite\nfrightened this time, and said in an anxious tone, as she picked him up,\n“I hope no bones are broken?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“None to speak of,” the Knight said, as if he didn’t mind\nbreaking two or three of them. “The great art of riding, as I was saying,\nis—to keep your balance properly. Like this, you know—”\n</p>\n<p>\nHe let go the bridle, and stretched out both his arms to show Alice what he\nmeant, and this time he fell flat on his back, right under the horse’s\nfeet.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Plenty of practice!” he went on repeating, all the time that Alice\nwas getting him on his feet again. “Plenty of practice!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“It’s too ridiculous!” cried Alice, losing all her patience\nthis time. “You ought to have a wooden horse on wheels, that you\nought!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Does that kind go smoothly?” the Knight asked in a tone of great\ninterest, clasping his arms round the horse’s neck as he spoke, just in\ntime to save himself from tumbling off again.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Much more smoothly than a live horse,” Alice said, with a little\nscream of laughter, in spite of all she could do to prevent it.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’ll get one,” the Knight said thoughtfully to himself.\n“One or two—several.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was a short silence after this, and then the Knight went on again.\n“I’m a great hand at inventing things. Now, I daresay you noticed,\nthat last time you picked me up, that I was looking rather thoughtful?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“You <i>were</i> a little grave,” said Alice.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well, just then I was inventing a new way of getting over a\ngate—would you like to hear it?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Very much indeed,” Alice said politely.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’ll tell you how I came to think of it,” said the Knight.\n“You see, I said to myself, ‘The only difficulty is with the feet:\nthe <i>head</i> is high enough already.’ Now, first I put my head on the\ntop of the gate—then I stand on my head—then the feet are high\nenough, you see—then I’m over, you see.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Yes, I suppose you’d be over when that was done,” Alice said\nthoughtfully: “but don’t you think it would be rather hard?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I haven’t tried it yet,” the Knight said, gravely: “so\nI can’t tell for certain—but I’m afraid it <i>would</i> be a\nlittle hard.”\n</p>\n<p>\nHe looked so vexed at the idea, that Alice changed the subject hastily.\n“What a curious helmet you’ve got!” she said cheerfully.\n“Is that your invention too?”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Knight looked down proudly at his helmet, which hung from the saddle.\n“Yes,” he said, “but I’ve invented a better one than\nthat—like a sugar loaf. When I used to wear it, if I fell off the horse,\nit always touched the ground directly. So I had a <i>very</i> little way to\nfall, you see—But there <i>was</i> the danger of falling <i>into</i> it,\nto be sure. That happened to me once—and the worst of it was, before I\ncould get out again, the other White Knight came and put it on. He thought it\nwas his own helmet.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe knight looked so solemn about it that Alice did not dare to laugh.\n“I’m afraid you must have hurt him,” she said in a trembling\nvoice, “being on the top of his head.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I had to kick him, of course,” the Knight said, very seriously.\n“And then he took the helmet off again—but it took hours and hours\nto get me out. I was as fast as—as lightning, you know.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“But that’s a different kind of fastness,” Alice objected.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Knight shook his head. “It was all kinds of fastness with me, I can\nassure you!” he said. He raised his hands in some excitement as he said\nthis, and instantly rolled out of the saddle, and fell headlong into a deep\nditch.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice ran to the side of the ditch to look for him. She was rather startled by\nthe fall, as for some time he had kept on very well, and she was afraid that he\nreally <i>was</i> hurt this time. However, though she could see nothing but the\nsoles of his feet, she was much relieved to hear that he was talking on in his\nusual tone. “All kinds of fastness,” he repeated: “but it was\ncareless of him to put another man’s helmet on—with the man in it,\ntoo.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“How <i>can</i> you go on talking so quietly, head downwards?”\nAlice asked, as she dragged him out by the feet, and laid him in a heap on the\nbank.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Knight looked surprised at the question. “What does it matter where\nmy body happens to be?” he said. “My mind goes on working all the\nsame. In fact, the more head downwards I am, the more I keep inventing new\nthings.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Now the cleverest thing of the sort that I ever did,” he went on\nafter a pause, “was inventing a new pudding during the\nmeat-course.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“In time to have it cooked for the next course?” said Alice.\n“Well, not the <i>next</i> course,” the Knight said in a slow\nthoughtful tone: “no, certainly not the next <i>course</i>.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Then it would have to be the next day. I suppose you wouldn’t have\ntwo pudding-courses in one dinner?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well, not the <i>next</i> day,” the Knight repeated as before:\n“not the next <i>day</i>. In fact,” he went on, holding his head\ndown, and his voice getting lower and lower, “I don’t believe that\npudding ever <i>was</i> cooked! In fact, I don’t believe that pudding\never <i>will</i> be cooked! And yet it was a very clever pudding to\ninvent.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“What did you mean it to be made of?” Alice asked, hoping to cheer\nhim up, for the poor Knight seemed quite low-spirited about it.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It began with blotting paper,” the Knight answered with a groan.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That wouldn’t be very nice, I’m afraid—”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Not very nice <i>alone</i>,” he interrupted, quite eagerly:\n“but you’ve no idea what a difference it makes mixing it with other\nthings—such as gunpowder and sealing-wax. And here I must leave\nyou.” They had just come to the end of the wood.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice could only look puzzled: she was thinking of the pudding.\n</p>\n<p>\n“You are sad,” the Knight said in an anxious tone: “let me\nsing you a song to comfort you.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Is it very long?” Alice asked, for she had heard a good deal of\npoetry that day.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It’s long,” said the Knight, “but very, <i>very</i>\nbeautiful. Everybody that hears me sing it—either it brings the\n<i>tears</i> into their eyes, or else—”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Or else what?” said Alice, for the Knight had made a sudden pause.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Or else it doesn’t, you know. The name of the song is called\n‘<i>Haddocks’ Eyes</i>.’”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Oh, that’s the name of the song, is it?” Alice said, trying\nto feel interested.\n</p>\n<p>\n“No, you don’t understand,” the Knight said, looking a little\nvexed. “That’s what the name is <i>called</i>. The name really\n<i>is</i> ‘<i>The Aged Aged Man</i>.’”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Then I ought to have said ‘That’s what the <i>song</i> is\ncalled’?” Alice corrected herself.\n</p>\n<p>\n“No, you oughtn’t: that’s quite another thing! The\n<i>song</i> is called ‘<i>Ways and Means</i>’: but that’s\nonly what it’s <i>called</i>, you know!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well, what <i>is</i> the song, then?” said Alice, who was by this\ntime completely bewildered.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was coming to that,” the Knight said. “The song really\n<i>is</i> ‘<i>A-sitting On A Gate</i>’: and the tune’s my own\ninvention.”\n</p>\n<p>\nSo saying, he stopped his horse and let the reins fall on its neck: then,\nslowly beating time with one hand, and with a faint smile lighting up his\ngentle foolish face, as if he enjoyed the music of his song, he began.\n</p>\n<p>\nOf all the strange things that Alice saw in her journey Through The\nLooking-Glass, this was the one that she always remembered most clearly. Years\nafterwards she could bring the whole scene back again, as if it had been only\nyesterday—the mild blue eyes and kindly smile of the Knight—the\nsetting sun gleaming through his hair, and shining on his armour in a blaze of\nlight that quite dazzled her—the horse quietly moving about, with the\nreins hanging loose on his neck, cropping the grass at her feet—and the\nblack shadows of the forest behind—all this she took in like a picture,\nas, with one hand shading her eyes, she leant against a tree, watching the\nstrange pair, and listening, in a half dream, to the melancholy music of the\nsong.\n</p>\n<p>\n“But the tune <i>isn’t</i> his own invention,” she said to\nherself: “it’s ‘<i>I give thee all, I can no\nmore</i>.’” She stood and listened very attentively, but no tears\ncame into her eyes.\n</p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n“I’ll tell thee everything I can;<br/>\n    There’s little to relate.<br/>\nI saw an aged aged man,<br/>\n    A-sitting on a gate.<br/>\n‘Who are you, aged man?’ I said,<br/>\n    ‘and how is it you live?’<br/>\nAnd his answer trickled through my head<br/>\n    Like water through a sieve.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said ‘I look for butterflies<br/>\n    That sleep among the wheat:<br/>\nI make them into mutton-pies,<br/>\n    And sell them in the street.<br/>\nI sell them unto men,’ he said,<br/>\n    ‘Who sail on stormy seas;<br/>\nAnd that’s the way I get my bread—<br/>\n    A trifle, if you please.’<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I was thinking of a plan<br/>\n    To dye one’s whiskers green,<br/>\nAnd always use so large a fan<br/>\n    That they could not be seen.<br/>\nSo, having no reply to give<br/>\n    To what the old man said,<br/>\nI cried, ‘Come, tell me how you live!’<br/>\n    And thumped him on the head.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis accents mild took up the tale:<br/>\n    He said ‘I go my ways,<br/>\nAnd when I find a mountain-rill,<br/>\n    I set it in a blaze;<br/>\nAnd thence they make a stuff they call<br/>\n    Rolands’ Macassar Oil—<br/>\nYet twopence-halfpenny is all<br/>\n    They give me for my toil.’<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I was thinking of a way<br/>\n    To feed oneself on batter,<br/>\nAnd so go on from day to day<br/>\n    Getting a little fatter.<br/>\nI shook him well from side to side,<br/>\n    Until his face was blue:<br/>\n‘Come, tell me how you live,’ I cried,<br/>\n    ‘And what it is you do!’<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said ‘I hunt for haddocks’ eyes<br/>\n    Among the heather bright,<br/>\nAnd work them into waistcoat-buttons<br/>\n    In the silent night.<br/>\nAnd these I do not sell for gold<br/>\n    Or coin of silvery shine<br/>\nBut for a copper halfpenny,<br/>\n    And that will purchase nine.<br/>\n<br/>\n‘I sometimes dig for buttered rolls,<br/>\n    Or set limed twigs for crabs;<br/>\nI sometimes search the grassy knolls<br/>\n    For wheels of Hansom-cabs.<br/>\nAnd that’s the way’ (he gave a wink)<br/>\n    ‘By which I get my wealth—<br/>\nAnd very gladly will I drink<br/>\n    Your Honour’s noble health.’<br/>\n<br/>\nI heard him then, for I had just<br/>\n    Completed my design<br/>\nTo keep the Menai bridge from rust<br/>\n    By boiling it in wine.<br/>\nI thanked him much for telling me<br/>\n    The way he got his wealth,<br/>\nBut chiefly for his wish that he<br/>\n    Might drink my noble health.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now, if e’er by chance I put<br/>\n    My fingers into glue<br/>\nOr madly squeeze a right-hand foot<br/>\n    Into a left-hand shoe,<br/>\nOr if I drop upon my toe<br/>\n    A very heavy weight,<br/>\nI weep, for it reminds me so,<br/>\nOf that old man I used to know—<br/>\nWhose look was mild, whose speech was slow,<br/>\nWhose hair was whiter than the snow,<br/>\nWhose face was very like a crow,<br/>\nWith eyes, like cinders, all aglow,<br/>\nWho seemed distracted with his woe,<br/>\nWho rocked his body to and fro,<br/>\nAnd muttered mumblingly and low,<br/>\nAs if his mouth were full of dough,<br/>\nWho snorted like a buffalo—<br/>\nThat summer evening, long ago,<br/>\n    A-sitting on a gate.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the Knight sang the last words of the ballad, he gathered up the reins, and\nturned his horse’s head along the road by which they had come.\n“You’ve only a few yards to go,” he said, “down the\nhill and over that little brook, and then you’ll be a Queen—But\nyou’ll stay and see me off first?” he added as Alice turned with an\neager look in the direction to which he pointed. “I shan’t be long.\nYou’ll wait and wave your handkerchief when I get to that turn in the\nroad? I think it’ll encourage me, you see.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Of course I’ll wait,” said Alice: “and thank you very\nmuch for coming so far—and for the song—I liked it very\nmuch.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I hope so,” the Knight said doubtfully: “but you\ndidn’t cry so much as I thought you would.”\n</p>\n<p>\nSo they shook hands, and then the Knight rode slowly away into the forest.\n“It won’t take long to see him <i>off</i>, I expect,” Alice\nsaid to herself, as she stood watching him. “There he goes! Right on his\nhead as usual! However, he gets on again pretty easily—that comes of\nhaving so many things hung round the horse—” So she went on talking\nto herself, as she watched the horse walking leisurely along the road, and the\nKnight tumbling off, first on one side and then on the other. After the fourth\nor fifth tumble he reached the turn, and then she waved her handkerchief to\nhim, and waited till he was out of sight.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I hope it encouraged him,” she said, as she turned to run down the\nhill: “and now for the last brook, and to be a Queen! How grand it\nsounds!” A very few steps brought her to the edge of the brook.\n“The Eighth Square at last!” she cried as she bounded across,\n</p>\n<p class=\"asterism\">\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n<br/>\n    *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n<br/>\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\nand threw herself down to rest on a lawn as soft as moss, with little\nflower-beds dotted about it here and there. “Oh, how glad I am to get\nhere! And what <i>is</i> this on my head?” she exclaimed in a tone of\ndismay, as she put her hands up to something very heavy, and fitted tight all\nround her head.\n</p>\n<p>\n“But how <i>can</i> it have got there without my knowing it?” she\nsaid to herself, as she lifted it off, and set it on her lap to make out what\nit could possibly be.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was a golden crown.\n</p>"
