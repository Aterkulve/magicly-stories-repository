  "content": "<p>\n“Well, this <i>is</i> grand!” said Alice. “I never expected I\nshould be a Queen so soon—and I’ll tell you what it is, your\nmajesty,” she went on in a severe tone (she was always rather fond of\nscolding herself), “it’ll never do for you to be lolling about on\nthe grass like that! Queens have to be dignified, you know!”\n</p>\n<p>\nSo she got up and walked about—rather stiffly just at first, as she was\nafraid that the crown might come off: but she comforted herself with the\nthought that there was nobody to see her, “and if I really am a\nQueen,” she said as she sat down again, “I shall be able to manage\nit quite well in time.”\n</p>\n<p>\nEverything was happening so oddly that she didn’t feel a bit surprised at\nfinding the Red Queen and the White Queen sitting close to her, one on each\nside: she would have liked very much to ask them how they came there, but she\nfeared it would not be quite civil. However, there would be no harm, she\nthought, in asking if the game was over. “Please, would you tell\nme—” she began, looking timidly at the Red Queen.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Speak when you’re spoken to!” The Queen sharply interrupted\nher.\n</p>\n<p>\n“But if everybody obeyed that rule,” said Alice, who was always\nready for a little argument, “and if you only spoke when you were spoken\nto, and the other person always waited for <i>you</i> to begin, you see nobody\nwould ever say anything, so that—”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Ridiculous!” cried the Queen. “Why, don’t you see,\nchild—” here she broke off with a frown, and, after thinking for a\nminute, suddenly changed the subject of the conversation. “What do you\nmean by ‘If you really are a Queen’? What right have you to call\nyourself so? You can’t be a Queen, you know, till you’ve passed the\nproper examination. And the sooner we begin it, the better.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I only said ‘if’!” poor Alice pleaded in a piteous\ntone.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe two Queens looked at each other, and the Red Queen remarked, with a little\nshudder, “She <i>says</i> she only said ‘if’—”\n</p>\n<p>\n“But she said a great deal more than that!” the White Queen moaned,\nwringing her hands. “Oh, ever so much more than that!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“So you did, you know,” the Red Queen said to Alice. “Always\nspeak the truth—think before you speak—and write it down\nafterwards.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’m sure I didn’t mean—” Alice was beginning,\nbut the Red Queen interrupted her impatiently.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That’s just what I complain of! You <i>should</i> have meant! What\ndo you suppose is the use of child without any meaning? Even a joke should have\nsome meaning—and a child’s more important than a joke, I hope. You\ncouldn’t deny that, even if you tried with both hands.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I don’t deny things with my <i>hands</i>,” Alice objected.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Nobody said you did,” said the Red Queen. “I said you\ncouldn’t if you tried.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“She’s in that state of mind,” said the White Queen,\n“that she wants to deny <i>something</i>—only she doesn’t\nknow what to deny!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“A nasty, vicious temper,” the Red Queen remarked; and then there\nwas an uncomfortable silence for a minute or two.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Red Queen broke the silence by saying to the White Queen, “I invite\nyou to Alice’s dinner-party this afternoon.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe White Queen smiled feebly, and said “And I invite <i>you</i>.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I didn’t know I was to have a party at all,” said Alice;\n“but if there is to be one, I think <i>I</i> ought to invite the\nguests.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“We gave you the opportunity of doing it,” the Red Queen remarked:\n“but I daresay you’ve not had many lessons in manners yet?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Manners are not taught in lessons,” said Alice. “Lessons\nteach you to do sums, and things of that sort.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“And you do Addition?” the White Queen asked. “What’s\none and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and\none?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I don’t know,” said Alice. “I lost count.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“She can’t do Addition,” the Red Queen interrupted.\n“Can you do Subtraction? Take nine from eight.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Nine from eight I can’t, you know,” Alice replied very\nreadily: “but—”\n</p>\n<p>\n“She can’t do Subtraction,” said the White Queen. “Can\nyou do Division? Divide a loaf by a knife—what’s the answer to\nthat?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I suppose—” Alice was beginning, but the Red Queen answered\nfor her. “Bread-and-butter, of course. Try another Subtraction sum. Take\na bone from a dog: what remains?”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice considered. “The bone wouldn’t remain, of course, if I took\nit—and the dog wouldn’t remain; it would come to bite me—and\nI’m sure <i>I</i> shouldn’t remain!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Then you think nothing would remain?” said the Red Queen.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I think that’s the answer.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Wrong, as usual,” said the Red Queen: “the dog’s\ntemper would remain.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“But I don’t see how—”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Why, look here!” the Red Queen cried. “The dog would lose\nits temper, wouldn’t it?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Perhaps it would,” Alice replied cautiously.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Then if the dog went away, its temper would remain!” the Queen\nexclaimed triumphantly.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice said, as gravely as she could, “They might go different\nways.” But she couldn’t help thinking to herself, “What\ndreadful nonsense we <i>are</i> talking!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“She can’t do sums a <i>bit</i>!” the Queens said together,\nwith great emphasis.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Can <i>you</i> do sums?” Alice said, turning suddenly on the White\nQueen, for she didn’t like being found fault with so much.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Queen gasped and shut her eyes. “I can do Addition, if you give me\ntime—but I can’t do Subtraction, under <i>any</i>\ncircumstances!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Of course you know your A B C?” said the Red Queen.\n</p>\n<p>\n“To be sure I do.” said Alice.\n</p>\n<p>\n“So do I,” the White Queen whispered: “we’ll often say\nit over together, dear. And I’ll tell you a secret—I can read words\nof one letter! Isn’t <i>that</i> grand! However, don’t be\ndiscouraged. You’ll come to it in time.”\n</p>\n<p>\nHere the Red Queen began again. “Can you answer useful questions?”\nshe said. “How is bread made?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I know <i>that</i>!” Alice cried eagerly. “You take some\nflour—”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Where do you pick the flower?” the White Queen asked. “In a\ngarden, or in the hedges?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well, it isn’t <i>picked</i> at all,” Alice explained:\n“it’s <i>ground</i>—”\n</p>\n<p>\n“How many acres of ground?” said the White Queen. “You\nmustn’t leave out so many things.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Fan her head!” the Red Queen anxiously interrupted.\n“She’ll be feverish after so much thinking.” So they set to\nwork and fanned her with bunches of leaves, till she had to beg them to leave\noff, it blew her hair about so.\n</p>\n<p>\n“She’s all right again now,” said the Red Queen. “Do\nyou know Languages? What’s the French for fiddle-de-dee?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Fiddle-de-dee’s not English,” Alice replied gravely.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Who ever said it was?” said the Red Queen.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice thought she saw a way out of the difficulty this time. “If\nyou’ll tell me what language ‘fiddle-de-dee’ is, I’ll\ntell you the French for it!” she exclaimed triumphantly.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the Red Queen drew herself up rather stiffly, and said “Queens never\nmake bargains.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I wish Queens never asked questions,” Alice thought to herself.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Don’t let us quarrel,” the White Queen said in an anxious\ntone. “What is the cause of lightning?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“The cause of lightning,” Alice said very decidedly, for she felt\nquite certain about this, “is the thunder—no, no!” she\nhastily corrected herself. “I meant the other way.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“It’s too late to correct it,” said the Red Queen:\n“when you’ve once said a thing, that fixes it, and you must take\nthe consequences.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Which reminds me—” the White Queen said, looking down and\nnervously clasping and unclasping her hands, “we had <i>such</i> a\nthunderstorm last Tuesday—I mean one of the last set of Tuesdays, you\nknow.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice was puzzled. “In <i>our</i> country,” she remarked,\n“there’s only one day at a time.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Red Queen said, “That’s a poor thin way of doing things. Now\n<i>here</i>, we mostly have days and nights two or three at a time, and\nsometimes in the winter we take as many as five nights together—for\nwarmth, you know.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Are five nights warmer than one night, then?” Alice ventured to\nask.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Five times as warm, of course.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“But they should be five times as <i>cold</i>, by the same\nrule—”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Just so!” cried the Red Queen. “Five times as warm,\n<i>and</i> five times as cold—just as I’m five times as rich as you\nare, <i>and</i> five times as clever!”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice sighed and gave it up. “It’s exactly like a riddle with no\nanswer!” she thought.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Humpty Dumpty saw it too,” the White Queen went on in a low voice,\nmore as if she were talking to herself. “He came to the door with a\ncorkscrew in his hand—”\n</p>\n<p>\n“What did he want?” said the Red Queen.\n</p>\n<p>\n“He said he <i>would</i> come in,” the White Queen went on,\n“because he was looking for a hippopotamus. Now, as it happened, there\nwasn’t such a thing in the house, that morning.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Is there generally?” Alice asked in an astonished tone.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well, only on Thursdays,” said the Queen.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I know what he came for,” said Alice: “he wanted to punish\nthe fish, because—”\n</p>\n<p>\nHere the White Queen began again. “It was <i>such</i> a thunderstorm, you\ncan’t think!” (“She <i>never</i> could, you know,” said\nthe Red Queen.) “And part of the roof came off, and ever so much thunder\ngot in—and it went rolling round the room in great lumps—and\nknocking over the tables and things—till I was so frightened, I\ncouldn’t remember my own name!”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice thought to herself, “I never should <i>try</i> to remember my name\nin the middle of an accident! Where would be the use of it?” but she did\nnot say this aloud, for fear of hurting the poor Queen’s feeling.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Your Majesty must excuse her,” the Red Queen said to Alice, taking\none of the White Queen’s hands in her own, and gently stroking it:\n“she means well, but she can’t help saying foolish things, as a\ngeneral rule.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe White Queen looked timidly at Alice, who felt she <i>ought</i> to say\nsomething kind, but really couldn’t think of anything at the moment.\n</p>\n<p>\n“She never was really well brought up,” the Red Queen went on:\n“but it’s amazing how good-tempered she is! Pat her on the head,\nand see how pleased she’ll be!” But this was more than Alice had\ncourage to do.\n</p>\n<p>\n“A little kindness—and putting her hair in papers—would do\nwonders with her—”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe White Queen gave a deep sigh, and laid her head on Alice’s shoulder.\n“I <i>am</i> so sleepy?” she moaned.\n</p>\n<p>\n“She’s tired, poor thing!” said the Red Queen. “Smooth\nher hair—lend her your nightcap—and sing her a soothing\nlullaby.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I haven’t got a nightcap with me,” said Alice, as she tried\nto obey the first direction: “and I don’t know any soothing\nlullabies.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I must do it myself, then,” said the Red Queen, and she began:\n</p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n“Hush-a-by lady, in Alice’s lap!<br/>\nTill the feast’s ready, we’ve time for a nap:<br/>\nWhen the feast’s over, we’ll go to the ball—<br/>\nRed Queen, and White Queen, and Alice, and all!\n</p>\n<p>\n“And now you know the words,” she added, as she put her head down\non Alice’s other shoulder, “just sing it through to <i>me</i>.\nI’m getting sleepy, too.” In another moment both Queens were fast\nasleep, and snoring loud.\n</p>\n<p>\n“What <i>am</i> I to do?” exclaimed Alice, looking about in great\nperplexity, as first one round head, and then the other, rolled down from her\nshoulder, and lay like a heavy lump in her lap. “I don’t think it\n<i>ever</i> happened before, that any one had to take care of two Queens asleep\nat once! No, not in all the History of England—it couldn’t, you\nknow, because there never was more than one Queen at a time. Do wake up, you\nheavy things!” she went on in an impatient tone; but there was no answer\nbut a gentle snoring.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe snoring got more distinct every minute, and sounded more like a tune: at\nlast she could even make out the words, and she listened so eagerly that, when\nthe two great heads vanished from her lap, she hardly missed them.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe was standing before an arched doorway over which were the words QUEEN ALICE\nin large letters, and on each side of the arch there was a bell-handle; one was\nmarked “Visitors’ Bell,” and the other “Servants’\nBell.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’ll wait till the song’s over,” thought Alice,\n“and then I’ll ring—the—<i>which</i> bell must I\nring?” she went on, very much puzzled by the names. “I’m not\na visitor, and I’m not a servant. There <i>ought</i> to be one marked\n‘Queen,’ you know—”\n</p>\n<p>\nJust then the door opened a little way, and a creature with a long beak put its\nhead out for a moment and said “No admittance till the week after\nnext!” and shut the door again with a bang.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice knocked and rang in vain for a long time, but at last, a very old Frog,\nwho was sitting under a tree, got up and hobbled slowly towards her: he was\ndressed in bright yellow, and had enormous boots on.\n</p>\n<p>\n“What is it, now?” the Frog said in a deep hoarse whisper.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice turned round, ready to find fault with anybody. “Where’s the\nservant whose business it is to answer the door?” she began angrily.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Which door?” said the Frog.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice almost stamped with irritation at the slow drawl in which he spoke.\n“<i>This</i> door, of course!”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Frog looked at the door with his large dull eyes for a minute: then he went\nnearer and rubbed it with his thumb, as if he were trying whether the paint\nwould come off; then he looked at Alice.\n</p>\n<p>\n“To answer the door?” he said. “What’s it been asking\nof?” He was so hoarse that Alice could scarcely hear him.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I don’t know what you mean,” she said.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I talks English, doesn’t I?” the Frog went on. “Or are\nyou deaf? What did it ask you?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Nothing!” Alice said impatiently. “I’ve been knocking\nat it!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Shouldn’t do that—shouldn’t do that—” the\nFrog muttered. “Vexes it, you know.” Then he went up and gave the\ndoor a kick with one of his great feet. “You let <i>it</i> alone,”\nhe panted out, as he hobbled back to his tree, “and it’ll let\n<i>you</i> alone, you know.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAt this moment the door was flung open, and a shrill voice was heard singing:\n</p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n“To the Looking-Glass world it was Alice that said,<br/>\n‘I’ve a sceptre in hand, I’ve a crown on my head;<br/>\nLet the Looking-Glass creatures, whatever they be,<br/>\nCome and dine with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me.’”\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd hundreds of voices joined in the chorus:\n</p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n“Then fill up the glasses as quick as you can,<br/>\nAnd sprinkle the table with buttons and bran:<br/>\nPut cats in the coffee, and mice in the tea—<br/>\nAnd welcome Queen Alice with thirty-times-three!”\n</p>\n<p>\nThen followed a confused noise of cheering, and Alice thought to herself,\n“Thirty times three makes ninety. I wonder if any one’s\ncounting?” In a minute there was silence again, and the same shrill voice\nsang another verse;\n</p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n“‘O Looking-Glass creatures,’ quoth Alice, ‘draw\nnear!<br/>\n’Tis an honour to see me, a favour to hear:<br/>\n’Tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea<br/>\nAlong with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me!’”\n</p>\n<p>\nThen came the chorus again:—\n</p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n“Then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink,<br/>\nOr anything else that is pleasant to drink:<br/>\nMix sand with the cider, and wool with the wine—<br/>\nAnd welcome Queen Alice with ninety-times-nine!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Ninety times nine!” Alice repeated in despair, “Oh,\nthat’ll never be done! I’d better go in at once—” and\nthere was a dead silence the moment she appeared.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice glanced nervously along the table, as she walked up the large hall, and\nnoticed that there were about fifty guests, of all kinds: some were animals,\nsome birds, and there were even a few flowers among them. “I’m glad\nthey’ve come without waiting to be asked,” she thought: “I\nshould never have known who were the right people to invite!”\n</p>\n<p>\nThere were three chairs at the head of the table; the Red and White Queens had\nalready taken two of them, but the middle one was empty. Alice sat down in it,\nrather uncomfortable in the silence, and longing for some one to speak.\n</p>\n<p>\nAt last the Red Queen began. “You’ve missed the soup and\nfish,” she said. “Put on the joint!” And the waiters set a\nleg of mutton before Alice, who looked at it rather anxiously, as she had never\nhad to carve a joint before.\n</p>\n<p>\n“You look a little shy; let me introduce you to that leg of\nmutton,” said the Red Queen. “Alice—Mutton;\nMutton—Alice.” The leg of mutton got up in the dish and made a\nlittle bow to Alice; and Alice returned the bow, not knowing whether to be\nfrightened or amused.\n</p>\n<p>\n“May I give you a slice?” she said, taking up the knife and fork,\nand looking from one Queen to the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Certainly not,” the Red Queen said, very decidedly: “it\nisn’t etiquette to cut any one you’ve been introduced to. Remove\nthe joint!” And the waiters carried it off, and brought a large\nplum-pudding in its place.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I won’t be introduced to the pudding, please,” Alice said\nrather hastily, “or we shall get no dinner at all. May I give you\nsome?”\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the Red Queen looked sulky, and growled “Pudding—Alice;\nAlice—Pudding. Remove the pudding!” and the waiters took it away so\nquickly that Alice couldn’t return its bow.\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, she didn’t see why the Red Queen should be the only one to give\norders, so, as an experiment, she called out “Waiter! Bring back the\npudding!” and there it was again in a moment like a conjuring-trick. It\nwas so large that she couldn’t help feeling a <i>little</i> shy with it,\nas she had been with the mutton; however, she conquered her shyness by a great\neffort and cut a slice and handed it to the Red Queen.\n</p>\n<p>\n“What impertinence!” said the Pudding. “I wonder how\nyou’d like it, if I were to cut a slice out of <i>you</i>, you\ncreature!”\n</p>\n<p>\nIt spoke in a thick, suety sort of voice, and Alice hadn’t a word to say\nin reply: she could only sit and look at it and gasp.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Make a remark,” said the Red Queen: “it’s ridiculous\nto leave all the conversation to the pudding!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Do you know, I’ve had such a quantity of poetry repeated to me\nto-day,” Alice began, a little frightened at finding that, the moment she\nopened her lips, there was dead silence, and all eyes were fixed upon her;\n“and it’s a very curious thing, I think—every poem was about\nfishes in some way. Do you know why they’re so fond of fishes, all about\nhere?”\n</p>\n<p>\nShe spoke to the Red Queen, whose answer was a little wide of the mark.\n“As to fishes,” she said, very slowly and solemnly, putting her\nmouth close to Alice’s ear, “her White Majesty knows a lovely\nriddle—all in poetry—all about fishes. Shall she repeat it?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Her Red Majesty’s very kind to mention it,” the White Queen\nmurmured into Alice’s other ear, in a voice like the cooing of a pigeon.\n“It would be <i>such</i> a treat! May I?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Please do,” Alice said very politely.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe White Queen laughed with delight, and stroked Alice’s cheek. Then she\nbegan:\n</p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n    “‘First, the fish must be caught.’<br/>\nThat is easy: a baby, I think, could have caught it.<br/>\n    ‘Next, the fish must be bought.’<br/>\nThat is easy: a penny, I think, would have bought it.<br/>\n<br/>\n    ‘Now cook me the fish!’<br/>\nThat is easy, and will not take more than a minute.<br/>\n    ‘Let it lie in a dish!’<br/>\nThat is easy, because it already is in it.<br/>\n<br/>\n    ‘Bring it here! Let me sup!’<br/>\nIt is easy to set such a dish on the table.<br/>\n    ‘Take the dish-cover up!’<br/>\nAh, that is so hard that I fear I’m unable!<br/>\n<br/>\n    For it holds it like glue—<br/>\nHolds the lid to the dish, while it lies in the middle:<br/>\n    Which is easiest to do,<br/>\nUn-dish-cover the fish, or dishcover the riddle?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Take a minute to think about it, and then guess,” said the Red\nQueen. “Meanwhile, we’ll drink your health—Queen\nAlice’s health!” she screamed at the top of her voice, and all the\nguests began drinking it directly, and very queerly they managed it: some of\nthem put their glasses upon their heads like extinguishers, and drank all that\ntrickled down their faces—others upset the decanters, and drank the wine\nas it ran off the edges of the table—and three of them (who looked like\nkangaroos) scrambled into the dish of roast mutton, and began eagerly lapping\nup the gravy, “just like pigs in a trough!” thought Alice.\n</p>\n<p>\n“You ought to return thanks in a neat speech,” the Red Queen said,\nfrowning at Alice as she spoke.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We must support you, you know,” the White Queen whispered, as\nAlice got up to do it, very obediently, but a little frightened.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Thank you very much,” she whispered in reply, “but I can do\nquite well without.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“That wouldn’t be at all the thing,” the Red Queen said very\ndecidedly: so Alice tried to submit to it with a good grace.\n</p>\n<p>\n(“And they <i>did</i> push so!” she said afterwards, when she was\ntelling her sister the history of the feast. “You would have thought they\nwanted to squeeze me flat!”)\n</p>\n<p>\nIn fact it was rather difficult for her to keep in her place while she made her\nspeech: the two Queens pushed her so, one on each side, that they nearly lifted\nher up into the air: “I rise to return thanks—” Alice began:\nand she really <i>did</i> rise as she spoke, several inches; but she got hold\nof the edge of the table, and managed to pull herself down again.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Take care of yourself!” screamed the White Queen, seizing\nAlice’s hair with both her hands. “Something’s going to\nhappen!”\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd then (as Alice afterwards described it) all sorts of things happened in a\nmoment. The candles all grew up to the ceiling, looking something like a bed of\nrushes with fireworks at the top. As to the bottles, they each took a pair of\nplates, which they hastily fitted on as wings, and so, with forks for legs,\nwent fluttering about in all directions: “and very like birds they\nlook,” Alice thought to herself, as well as she could in the dreadful\nconfusion that was beginning.\n</p>\n<p>\nAt this moment she heard a hoarse laugh at her side, and turned to see what was\nthe matter with the White Queen; but, instead of the Queen, there was the leg\nof mutton sitting in the chair. “Here I am!” cried a voice from the\nsoup tureen, and Alice turned again, just in time to see the Queen’s\nbroad good-natured face grinning at her for a moment over the edge of the\ntureen, before she disappeared into the soup.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was not a moment to be lost. Already several of the guests were lying\ndown in the dishes, and the soup ladle was walking up the table towards\nAlice’s chair, and beckoning to her impatiently to get out of its way.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I can’t stand this any longer!” she cried as she jumped up\nand seized the table-cloth with both hands: one good pull, and plates, dishes,\nguests, and candles came crashing down together in a heap on the floor.\n</p>\n<p>\n“And as for <i>you</i>,” she went on, turning fiercely upon the Red\nQueen, whom she considered as the cause of all the mischief—but the Queen\nwas no longer at her side—she had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a\nlittle doll, and was now on the table, merrily running round and round after\nher own shawl, which was trailing behind her.\n</p>\n<p>\nAt any other time, Alice would have felt surprised at this, but she was far too\nmuch excited to be surprised at anything <i>now</i>. “As for\n<i>you</i>,” she repeated, catching hold of the little creature in the\nvery act of jumping over a bottle which had just lighted upon the table,\n“I’ll shake you into a kitten, that I will!”\n</p>"
