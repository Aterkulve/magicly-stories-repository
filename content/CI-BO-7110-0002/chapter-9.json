  "content": "<p>\nThe next moment soldiers came running through the wood, at first in twos and\nthrees, then ten or twenty together, and at last in such crowds that they\nseemed to fill the whole forest. Alice got behind a tree, for fear of being run\nover, and watched them go by.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe thought that in all her life she had never seen soldiers so uncertain on\ntheir feet: they were always tripping over something or other, and whenever one\nwent down, several more always fell over him, so that the ground was soon\ncovered with little heaps of men.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen came the horses. Having four feet, these managed rather better than the\nfoot-soldiers: but even <i>they</i> stumbled now and then; and it seemed to be\na regular rule that, whenever a horse stumbled the rider fell off instantly.\nThe confusion got worse every moment, and Alice was very glad to get out of the\nwood into an open place, where she found the White King seated on the ground,\nbusily writing in his memorandum-book.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’ve sent them all!” the King cried in a tone of delight, on\nseeing Alice. “Did you happen to meet any soldiers, my dear, as you came\nthrough the wood?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Yes, I did,” said Alice: “several thousand, I should\nthink.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Four thousand two hundred and seven, that’s the exact\nnumber,” the King said, referring to his book. “I couldn’t\nsend all the horses, you know, because two of them are wanted in the game. And\nI haven’t sent the two Messengers, either. They’re both gone to the\ntown. Just look along the road, and tell me if you can see either of\nthem.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I see nobody on the road,” said Alice.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I only wish <i>I</i> had such eyes,” the King remarked in a\nfretful tone. “To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why,\nit’s as much as <i>I</i> can do to see real people, by this light!”\n</p>\n<p>\nAll this was lost on Alice, who was still looking intently along the road,\nshading her eyes with one hand. “I see somebody now!” she exclaimed\nat last. “But he’s coming very slowly—and what curious\nattitudes he goes into!” (For the messenger kept skipping up and down,\nand wriggling like an eel, as he came along, with his great hands spread out\nlike fans on each side.)\n</p>\n<p>\n“Not at all,” said the King. “He’s an Anglo-Saxon\nMessenger—and those are Anglo-Saxon attitudes. He only does them when\nhe’s happy. His name is Haigha.” (He pronounced it so as to rhyme\nwith “mayor.”)\n</p>\n<p>\n“I love my love with an H,” Alice couldn’t help beginning,\n“because he is Happy. I hate him with an H, because he is Hideous. I fed\nhim with—with—with Ham-sandwiches and Hay. His name is Haigha, and\nhe lives—”\n</p>\n<p>\n“He lives on the Hill,” the King remarked simply, without the least\nidea that he was joining in the game, while Alice was still hesitating for the\nname of a town beginning with H. “The other Messenger’s called\nHatta. I must have <i>two</i>, you know—to come and go. One to come, and\none to go.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I beg your pardon?” said Alice.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It isn’t respectable to beg,” said the King.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I only meant that I didn’t understand,” said Alice.\n“Why one to come and one to go?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Didn’t I tell you?” the King repeated impatiently. “I\nmust have <i>two</i>—to fetch and carry. One to fetch, and one to\ncarry.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAt this moment the Messenger arrived: he was far too much out of breath to say\na word, and could only wave his hands about, and make the most fearful faces at\nthe poor King.\n</p>\n<p>\n“This young lady loves you with an H,” the King said, introducing\nAlice in the hope of turning off the Messenger’s attention from\nhimself—but it was no use—the Anglo-Saxon attitudes only got more\nextraordinary every moment, while the great eyes rolled wildly from side to\nside.\n</p>\n<p>\n“You alarm me!” said the King. “I feel faint—Give me a\nham sandwich!”\n</p>\n<p>\nOn which the Messenger, to Alice’s great amusement, opened a bag that\nhung round his neck, and handed a sandwich to the King, who devoured it\ngreedily.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Another sandwich!” said the King.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There’s nothing but hay left now,” the Messenger said,\npeeping into the bag.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Hay, then,” the King murmured in a faint whisper.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice was glad to see that it revived him a good deal. “There’s\nnothing like eating hay when you’re faint,” he remarked to her, as\nhe munched away.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I should think throwing cold water over you would be better,”\nAlice suggested: “or some sal-volatile.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I didn’t say there was nothing <i>better</i>,” the King\nreplied. “I said there was nothing <i>like</i> it.” Which Alice did\nnot venture to deny.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Who did you pass on the road?” the King went on, holding out his\nhand to the Messenger for some more hay.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Nobody,” said the Messenger.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Quite right,” said the King: “this young lady saw him too.\nSo of course Nobody walks slower than you.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I do my best,” the Messenger said in a sulky tone.\n“I’m sure nobody walks much faster than I do!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“He can’t do that,” said the King, “or else he’d\nhave been here first. However, now you’ve got your breath, you may tell\nus what’s happened in the town.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’ll whisper it,” said the Messenger, putting his hands to\nhis mouth in the shape of a trumpet, and stooping so as to get close to the\nKing’s ear. Alice was sorry for this, as she wanted to hear the news too.\nHowever, instead of whispering, he simply shouted at the top of his voice\n“They’re at it again!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Do you call <i>that</i> a whisper?” cried the poor King, jumping\nup and shaking himself. “If you do such a thing again, I’ll have\nyou buttered! It went through and through my head like an earthquake!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“It would have to be a very tiny earthquake!” thought Alice.\n“Who are at it again?” she ventured to ask.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Why the Lion and the Unicorn, of course,” said the King.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Fighting for the crown?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Yes, to be sure,” said the King: “and the best of the joke\nis, that it’s <i>my</i> crown all the while! Let’s run and see\nthem.” And they trotted off, Alice repeating to herself, as she ran, the\nwords of the old song:—\n</p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n“The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the crown:<br/>\nThe Lion beat the Unicorn all round the town.<br/>\nSome gave them white bread, some gave them brown;<br/>\nSome gave them plum-cake and drummed them out of town.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Does—the one—that wins—get the crown?” she\nasked, as well as she could, for the run was putting her quite out of breath.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Dear me, no!” said the King. “What an idea!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Would you—be good enough,” Alice panted out, after running a\nlittle further, “to stop a minute—just to get—one’s\nbreath again?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’m <i>good</i> enough,” the King said, “only\nI’m not strong enough. You see, a minute goes by so fearfully quick. You\nmight as well try to stop a Bandersnatch!”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice had no more breath for talking, so they trotted on in silence, till they\ncame in sight of a great crowd, in the middle of which the Lion and Unicorn\nwere fighting. They were in such a cloud of dust, that at first Alice could not\nmake out which was which: but she soon managed to distinguish the Unicorn by\nhis horn.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey placed themselves close to where Hatta, the other messenger, was standing\nwatching the fight, with a cup of tea in one hand and a piece of\nbread-and-butter in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n“He’s only just out of prison, and he hadn’t finished his tea\nwhen he was sent in,” Haigha whispered to Alice: “and they only\ngive them oyster-shells in there—so you see he’s very hungry and\nthirsty. How are you, dear child?” he went on, putting his arm\naffectionately round Hatta’s neck.\n</p>\n<p>\nHatta looked round and nodded, and went on with his bread and butter.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Were you happy in prison, dear child?” said Haigha.\n</p>\n<p>\nHatta looked round once more, and this time a tear or two trickled down his\ncheek: but not a word would he say.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Speak, can’t you!” Haigha cried impatiently. But Hatta only\nmunched away, and drank some more tea.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Speak, won’t you!” cried the King. “How are they\ngetting on with the fight?”\n</p>\n<p>\nHatta made a desperate effort, and swallowed a large piece of bread-and-butter.\n“They’re getting on very well,” he said in a choking voice:\n“each of them has been down about eighty-seven times.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Then I suppose they’ll soon bring the white bread and the\nbrown?” Alice ventured to remark.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It’s waiting for ’em now,” said Hatta: “this is\na bit of it as I’m eating.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was a pause in the fight just then, and the Lion and the Unicorn sat\ndown, panting, while the King called out “Ten minutes allowed for\nrefreshments!” Haigha and Hatta set to work at once, carrying rough trays\nof white and brown bread. Alice took a piece to taste, but it was <i>very</i>\ndry.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I don’t think they’ll fight any more to-day,” the King\nsaid to Hatta: “go and order the drums to begin.” And Hatta went\nbounding away like a grasshopper.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor a minute or two Alice stood silent, watching him. Suddenly she brightened\nup. “Look, look!” she cried, pointing eagerly. “There’s\nthe White Queen running across the country! She came flying out of the wood\nover yonder—How fast those Queens <i>can</i> run!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“There’s some enemy after her, no doubt,” the King said,\nwithout even looking round. “That wood’s full of them.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“But aren’t you going to run and help her?” Alice asked, very\nmuch surprised at his taking it so quietly.\n</p>\n<p>\n“No use, no use!” said the King. “She runs so fearfully\nquick. You might as well try to catch a Bandersnatch! But I’ll make a\nmemorandum about her, if you like—She’s a dear good\ncreature,” he repeated softly to himself, as he opened his\nmemorandum-book. “Do you spell ‘creature’ with a double\n‘e’?”\n</p>\n<p>\nAt this moment the Unicorn sauntered by them, with his hands in his pockets.\n“I had the best of it this time?” he said to the King, just\nglancing at him as he passed.\n</p>\n<p>\n“A little—a little,” the King replied, rather nervously.\n“You shouldn’t have run him through with your horn, you\nknow.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“It didn’t hurt him,” the Unicorn said carelessly, and he was\ngoing on, when his eye happened to fall upon Alice: he turned round rather\ninstantly, and stood for some time looking at her with an air of the deepest\ndisgust.\n</p>\n<p>\n“What—is—this?” he said at last.\n</p>\n<p>\n“This is a child!” Haigha replied eagerly, coming in front of Alice\nto introduce her, and spreading out both his hands towards her in an\nAnglo-Saxon attitude. “We only found it to-day. It’s as large as\nlife, and twice as natural!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I always thought they were fabulous monsters!” said the Unicorn.\n“Is it alive?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“It can talk,” said Haigha, solemnly.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Unicorn looked dreamily at Alice, and said “Talk, child.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice could not help her lips curling up into a smile as she began: “Do\nyou know, I always thought Unicorns were fabulous monsters, too! I never saw\none alive before!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well, now that we <i>have</i> seen each other,” said the Unicorn,\n“if you’ll believe in me, I’ll believe in you. Is that a\nbargain?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Yes, if you like,” said Alice.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Come, fetch out the plum-cake, old man!” the Unicorn went on,\nturning from her to the King. “None of your brown bread for me!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Certainly—certainly!” the King muttered, and beckoned to\nHaigha. “Open the bag!” he whispered. “Quick! Not that\none—that’s full of hay!”\n</p>\n<p>\nHaigha took a large cake out of the bag, and gave it to Alice to hold, while he\ngot out a dish and carving-knife. How they all came out of it Alice\ncouldn’t guess. It was just like a conjuring-trick, she thought.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Lion had joined them while this was going on: he looked very tired and\nsleepy, and his eyes were half shut. “What’s this!” he said,\nblinking lazily at Alice, and speaking in a deep hollow tone that sounded like\nthe tolling of a great bell.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Ah, what <i>is</i> it, now?” the Unicorn cried eagerly.\n“You’ll never guess! <i>I</i> couldn’t.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Lion looked at Alice wearily. “Are you\nanimal—vegetable—or mineral?” he said, yawning at every other\nword.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It’s a fabulous monster!” the Unicorn cried out, before\nAlice could reply.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Then hand round the plum-cake, Monster,” the Lion said, lying down\nand putting his chin on his paws. “And sit down, both of you,” (to\nthe King and the Unicorn): “fair play with the cake, you know!”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe King was evidently very uncomfortable at having to sit down between the two\ngreat creatures; but there was no other place for him.\n</p>\n<p>\n“What a fight we might have for the crown, <i>now</i>!” the Unicorn\nsaid, looking slyly up at the crown, which the poor King was nearly shaking off\nhis head, he trembled so much.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I should win easy,” said the Lion.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’m not so sure of that,” said the Unicorn.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Why, I beat you all round the town, you chicken!” the Lion replied\nangrily, half getting up as he spoke.\n</p>\n<p>\nHere the King interrupted, to prevent the quarrel going on: he was very\nnervous, and his voice quite quivered. “All round the town?” he\nsaid. “That’s a good long way. Did you go by the old bridge, or the\nmarket-place? You get the best view by the old bridge.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’m sure I don’t know,” the Lion growled out as he lay\ndown again. “There was too much dust to see anything. What a time the\nMonster is, cutting up that cake!”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook, with the great dish on\nher knees, and was sawing away diligently with the knife. “It’s\nvery provoking!” she said, in reply to the Lion (she was getting quite\nused to being called “the Monster”). “I’ve cut several\nslices already, but they always join on again!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“You don’t know how to manage Looking-glass cakes,” the\nUnicorn remarked. “Hand it round first, and cut it afterwards.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThis sounded nonsense, but Alice very obediently got up, and carried the dish\nround, and the cake divided itself into three pieces as she did so.\n“<i>Now</i> cut it up,” said the Lion, as she returned to her place\nwith the empty dish.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I say, this isn’t fair!” cried the Unicorn, as Alice sat\nwith the knife in her hand, very much puzzled how to begin. “The Monster\nhas given the Lion twice as much as me!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“She’s kept none for herself, anyhow,” said the Lion.\n“Do you like plum-cake, Monster?”\n</p>\n<p>\nBut before Alice could answer him, the drums began.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhere the noise came from, she couldn’t make out: the air seemed full of\nit, and it rang through and through her head till she felt quite deafened. She\nstarted to her feet and sprang across the little brook in her terror,\n</p>\n<p class=\"asterism\">\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n<br/>\n    *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n<br/>\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\nand had just time to see the Lion and the Unicorn rise to their feet, with\nangry looks at being interrupted in their feast, before she dropped to her\nknees, and put her hands over her ears, vainly trying to shut out the dreadful\nuproar.\n</p>\n<p>\n“If <i>that</i> doesn’t ‘drum them out of town,’”\nshe thought to herself, “nothing ever will!”\n</p>"
