  "content": "<p>\nShe caught the shawl as she spoke, and looked about for the owner: in another\nmoment the White Queen came running wildly through the wood, with both arms\nstretched out wide, as if she were flying, and Alice very civilly went to meet\nher with the shawl.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’m very glad I happened to be in the way,” Alice said, as\nshe helped her to put on her shawl again.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe White Queen only looked at her in a helpless frightened sort of way, and\nkept repeating something in a whisper to herself that sounded like\n“bread-and-butter, bread-and-butter,” and Alice felt that if there\nwas to be any conversation at all, she must manage it herself. So she began\nrather timidly: “Am I addressing the White Queen?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well, yes, if you call that a-dressing,” The Queen said. “It\nisn’t <i>my</i> notion of the thing, at all.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice thought it would never do to have an argument at the very beginning of\ntheir conversation, so she smiled and said, “If your Majesty will only\ntell me the right way to begin, I’ll do it as well as I can.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“But I don’t want it done at all!” groaned the poor Queen.\n“I’ve been a-dressing myself for the last two hours.”\n</p>\n<p>\nIt would have been all the better, as it seemed to Alice, if she had got some\none else to dress her, she was so dreadfully untidy. “Every single\nthing’s crooked,” Alice thought to herself, “and she’s\nall over pins!—may I put your shawl straight for you?” she added\naloud.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I don’t know what’s the matter with it!” the Queen\nsaid, in a melancholy voice. “It’s out of temper, I think.\nI’ve pinned it here, and I’ve pinned it there, but there’s no\npleasing it!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“It <i>can’t</i> go straight, you know, if you pin it all on one\nside,” Alice said, as she gently put it right for her; “and, dear\nme, what a state your hair is in!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“The brush has got entangled in it!” the Queen said with a sigh.\n“And I lost the comb yesterday.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice carefully released the brush, and did her best to get the hair into\norder. “Come, you look rather better now!” she said, after altering\nmost of the pins. “But really you should have a lady’s maid!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’m sure I’ll take you with pleasure!” the Queen said.\n“Twopence a week, and jam every other day.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice couldn’t help laughing, as she said, “I don’t want you\nto hire <i>me</i>—and I don’t care for jam.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“It’s very good jam,” said the Queen.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well, I don’t want any <i>to-day</i>, at any rate.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“You couldn’t have it if you <i>did</i> want it,” the Queen\nsaid. “The rule is, jam to-morrow and jam yesterday—but never jam\nto-day.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“It <i>must</i> come sometimes to ‘jam to-day,’” Alice\nobjected.\n</p>\n<p>\n“No, it can’t,” said the Queen. “It’s jam every\n<i>other</i> day: to-day isn’t any <i>other</i> day, you know.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I don’t understand you,” said Alice. “It’s\ndreadfully confusing!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“That’s the effect of living backwards,” the Queen said\nkindly: “it always makes one a little giddy at first—”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Living backwards!” Alice repeated in great astonishment. “I\nnever heard of such a thing!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“—but there’s one great advantage in it, that one’s\nmemory works both ways.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’m sure <i>mine</i> only works one way,” Alice remarked.\n“I can’t remember things before they happen.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“It’s a poor sort of memory that only works backwards,” the\nQueen remarked.\n</p>\n<p>\n“What sort of things do <i>you</i> remember best?” Alice ventured\nto ask.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Oh, things that happened the week after next,” the Queen replied\nin a careless tone. “For instance, now,” she went on, sticking a\nlarge piece of plaster on her finger as she spoke, “there’s the\nKing’s Messenger. He’s in prison now, being punished: and the trial\ndoesn’t even begin till next Wednesday: and of course the crime comes\nlast of all.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Suppose he never commits the crime?” said Alice.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That would be all the better, wouldn’t it?” the Queen said,\nas she bound the plaster round her finger with a bit of ribbon.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice felt there was no denying <i>that</i>. “Of course it would be all\nthe better,” she said: “but it wouldn’t be all the better his\nbeing punished.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“You’re wrong <i>there</i>, at any rate,” said the Queen:\n“were <i>you</i> ever punished?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Only for faults,” said Alice.\n</p>\n<p>\n“And you were all the better for it, I know!” the Queen said\ntriumphantly.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Yes, but then I <i>had</i> done the things I was punished for,”\nsaid Alice: “that makes all the difference.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“But if you <i>hadn’t</i> done them,” the Queen said,\n“that would have been better still; better, and better, and\nbetter!” Her voice went higher with each “better,” till it\ngot quite to a squeak at last.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice was just beginning to say “There’s a mistake\nsomewhere—,” when the Queen began screaming so loud that she had to\nleave the sentence unfinished. “Oh, oh, oh!” shouted the Queen,\nshaking her hand about as if she wanted to shake it off. “My\nfinger’s bleeding! Oh, oh, oh, oh!”\n</p>\n<p>\nHer screams were so exactly like the whistle of a steam-engine, that Alice had\nto hold both her hands over her ears.\n</p>\n<p>\n“What <i>is</i> the matter?” she said, as soon as there was a\nchance of making herself heard. “Have you pricked your finger?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I haven’t pricked it <i>yet</i>,” the Queen said, “but\nI soon shall—oh, oh, oh!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“When do you expect to do it?” Alice asked, feeling very much\ninclined to laugh.\n</p>\n<p>\n“When I fasten my shawl again,” the poor Queen groaned out:\n“the brooch will come undone directly. Oh, oh!” As she said the\nwords the brooch flew open, and the Queen clutched wildly at it, and tried to\nclasp it again.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Take care!” cried Alice. “You’re holding it all\ncrooked!” And she caught at the brooch; but it was too late: the pin had\nslipped, and the Queen had pricked her finger.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That accounts for the bleeding, you see,” she said to Alice with a\nsmile. “Now you understand the way things happen here.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“But why don’t you scream now?” Alice asked, holding her\nhands ready to put over her ears again.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Why, I’ve done all the screaming already,” said the Queen.\n“What would be the good of having it all over again?”\n</p>\n<p>\nBy this time it was getting light. “The crow must have flown away, I\nthink,” said Alice: “I’m so glad it’s gone. I thought\nit was the night coming on.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I wish <i>I</i> could manage to be glad!” the Queen said.\n“Only I never can remember the rule. You must be very happy, living in\nthis wood, and being glad whenever you like!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Only it is so <i>very</i> lonely here!” Alice said in a melancholy\nvoice; and at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came rolling down\nher cheeks.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Oh, don’t go on like that!” cried the poor Queen, wringing\nher hands in despair. “Consider what a great girl you are. Consider what\na long way you’ve come to-day. Consider what o’clock it is.\nConsider anything, only don’t cry!”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice could not help laughing at this, even in the midst of her tears.\n“Can <i>you</i> keep from crying by considering things?” she asked.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That’s the way it’s done,” the Queen said with great\ndecision: “nobody can do two things at once, you know. Let’s\nconsider your age to begin with—how old are you?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’m seven and a half exactly.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“You needn’t say ‘exactually,’” the Queen\nremarked: “I can believe it without that. Now I’ll give <i>you</i>\nsomething to believe. I’m just one hundred and one, five months and a\nday.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I can’t believe <i>that</i>!” said Alice.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Can’t you?” the Queen said in a pitying tone. “Try\nagain: draw a long breath, and shut your eyes.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice laughed. “There’s no use trying,” she said: “one\n<i>can’t</i> believe impossible things.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I daresay you haven’t had much practice,” said the Queen.\n“When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why,\nsometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before\nbreakfast. There goes the shawl again!”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe brooch had come undone as she spoke, and a sudden gust of wind blew the\nQueen’s shawl across a little brook. The Queen spread out her arms again,\nand went flying after it, and this time she succeeded in catching it for\nherself. “I’ve got it!” she cried in a triumphant tone.\n“Now you shall see me pin it on again, all by myself!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Then I hope your finger is better now?” Alice said very politely,\nas she crossed the little brook after the Queen.\n</p>\n<p class=\"asterism\">\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n<br/>\n    *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n<br/>\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n“Oh, much better!” cried the Queen, her voice rising to a squeak as\nshe went on. “Much be-etter! Be-etter! Be-e-e-etter! Be-e-ehh!” The\nlast word ended in a long bleat, so like a sheep that Alice quite started.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe looked at the Queen, who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up in\nwool. Alice rubbed her eyes, and looked again. She couldn’t make out what\nhad happened at all. Was she in a shop? And was that really—was it really\na <i>sheep</i> that was sitting on the other side of the counter? Rub as she\ncould, she could make nothing more of it: she was in a little dark shop,\nleaning with her elbows on the counter, and opposite to her was an old Sheep,\nsitting in an arm-chair knitting, and every now and then leaving off to look at\nher through a great pair of spectacles.\n</p>\n<p>\n“What is it you want to buy?” the Sheep said at last, looking up\nfor a moment from her knitting.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I don’t <i>quite</i> know yet,” Alice said, very gently.\n“I should like to look all round me first, if I might.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“You may look in front of you, and on both sides, if you like,”\nsaid the Sheep: “but you can’t look <i>all</i> round\nyou—unless you’ve got eyes at the back of your head.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBut these, as it happened, Alice had <i>not</i> got: so she contented herself\nwith turning round, looking at the shelves as she came to them.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things—but the oddest\npart of it all was, that whenever she looked hard at any shelf, to make out\nexactly what it had on it, that particular shelf was always quite empty: though\nthe others round it were crowded as full as they could hold.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Things flow about so here!” she said at last in a plaintive tone,\nafter she had spent a minute or so in vainly pursuing a large bright thing,\nthat looked sometimes like a doll and sometimes like a work-box, and was always\nin the shelf next above the one she was looking at. “And this one is the\nmost provoking of all—but I’ll tell you what—” she\nadded, as a sudden thought struck her, “I’ll follow it up to the\nvery top shelf of all. It’ll puzzle it to go through the ceiling, I\nexpect!”\n</p>\n<p>\nBut even this plan failed: the “thing” went through the ceiling as\nquietly as possible, as if it were quite used to it.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Are you a child or a teetotum?” the Sheep said, as she took up\nanother pair of needles. “You’ll make me giddy soon, if you go on\nturning round like that.” She was now working with fourteen pairs at\nonce, and Alice couldn’t help looking at her in great astonishment.\n</p>\n<p>\n“How <i>can</i> she knit with so many?” the puzzled child thought\nto herself. “She gets more and more like a porcupine every minute!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Can you row?” the Sheep asked, handing her a pair of\nknitting-needles as she spoke.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Yes, a little—but not on land—and not with\nneedles—” Alice was beginning to say, when suddenly the needles\nturned into oars in her hands, and she found they were in a little boat,\ngliding along between banks: so there was nothing for it but to do her best.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Feather!” cried the Sheep, as she took up another pair of needles.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis didn’t sound like a remark that needed any answer, so Alice said\nnothing, but pulled away. There was something very queer about the water, she\nthought, as every now and then the oars got fast in it, and would hardly come\nout again.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Feather! Feather!” the Sheep cried again, taking more needles.\n“You’ll be catching a crab directly.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“A dear little crab!” thought Alice. “I should like\nthat.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Didn’t you hear me say ‘Feather’?” the Sheep\ncried angrily, taking up quite a bunch of needles.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Indeed I did,” said Alice: “you’ve said it very\noften—and very loud. Please, where <i>are</i> the crabs?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“In the water, of course!” said the Sheep, sticking some of the\nneedles into her hair, as her hands were full. “Feather, I say!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“<i>Why</i> do you say ‘feather’ so often?” Alice asked\nat last, rather vexed. “I’m not a bird!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“You are,” said the Sheep: “you’re a little\ngoose.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThis offended Alice a little, so there was no more conversation for a minute or\ntwo, while the boat glided gently on, sometimes among beds of weeds (which made\nthe oars stick fast in the water, worse then ever), and sometimes under trees,\nbut always with the same tall river-banks frowning over their heads.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Oh, please! There are some scented rushes!” Alice cried in a\nsudden transport of delight. “There really are—and <i>such</i>\nbeauties!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“You needn’t say ‘please’ to <i>me</i> about\n’em,” the Sheep said, without looking up from her knitting:\n“I didn’t put ’em there, and I’m not going to take\n’em away.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“No, but I meant—please, may we wait and pick some?” Alice\npleaded. “If you don’t mind stopping the boat for a minute.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“How am <i>I</i> to stop it?” said the Sheep. “If you leave\noff rowing, it’ll stop of itself.”\n</p>\n<p>\nSo the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would, till it glided\ngently in among the waving rushes. And then the little sleeves were carefully\nrolled up, and the little arms were plunged in elbow-deep to get the rushes a\ngood long way down before breaking them off—and for a while Alice forgot\nall about the Sheep and the knitting, as she bent over the side of the boat,\nwith just the ends of her tangled hair dipping into the water—while with\nbright eager eyes she caught at one bunch after another of the darling scented\nrushes.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I only hope the boat won’t tipple over!” she said to\nherself. “Oh, <i>what</i> a lovely one! Only I couldn’t quite reach\nit.” And it certainly <i>did</i> seem a little provoking\n(“almost as if it happened on purpose,” she thought) that, though\nshe managed to pick plenty of beautiful rushes as the boat glided by, there was\nalways a more lovely one that she couldn’t reach.\n</p>\n<p>\n“The prettiest are always further!” she said at last, with a sigh\nat the obstinacy of the rushes in growing so far off, as, with flushed cheeks\nand dripping hair and hands, she scrambled back into her place, and began to\narrange her new-found treasures.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhat mattered it to her just then that the rushes had begun to fade, and to\nlose all their scent and beauty, from the very moment that she picked them?\nEven real scented rushes, you know, last only a very little while—and\nthese, being dream-rushes, melted away almost like snow, as they lay in heaps\nat her feet—but Alice hardly noticed this, there were so many other\ncurious things to think about.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey hadn’t gone much farther before the blade of one of the oars got\nfast in the water and <i>wouldn’t</i> come out again (so Alice explained\nit afterwards), and the consequence was that the handle of it caught her under\nthe chin, and, in spite of a series of little shrieks of “Oh, oh,\noh!” from poor Alice, it swept her straight off the seat, and down among\nthe heap of rushes.\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, she wasn’t hurt, and was soon up again: the Sheep went on with\nher knitting all the while, just as if nothing had happened. “That was a\nnice crab you caught!” she remarked, as Alice got back into her place,\nvery much relieved to find herself still in the boat.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Was it? I didn’t see it,” Said Alice, peeping cautiously\nover the side of the boat into the dark water. “I wish it hadn’t\nlet go—I should so like to see a little crab to take home with me!”\nBut the Sheep only laughed scornfully, and went on with her knitting.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Are there many crabs here?” said Alice.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Crabs, and all sorts of things,” said the Sheep: “plenty of\nchoice, only make up your mind. Now, what <i>do</i> you want to buy?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“To buy!” Alice echoed in a tone that was half astonished and half\nfrightened—for the oars, and the boat, and the river, had vanished all in\na moment, and she was back again in the little dark shop.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I should like to buy an egg, please,” she said timidly. “How\ndo you sell them?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Fivepence farthing for one—Twopence for two,” the Sheep\nreplied.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Then two are cheaper than one?” Alice said in a surprised tone,\ntaking out her purse.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Only you <i>must</i> eat them both, if you buy two,” said the\nSheep.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Then I’ll have <i>one</i>, please,” said Alice, as she put\nthe money down on the counter. For she thought to herself, “They\nmightn’t be at all nice, you know.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Sheep took the money, and put it away in a box: then she said “I\nnever put things into people’s hands—that would never do—you\nmust get it for yourself.” And so saying, she went off to the other end\nof the shop, and set the egg upright on a shelf.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I wonder <i>why</i> it wouldn’t do?” thought Alice, as she\ngroped her way among the tables and chairs, for the shop was very dark towards\nthe end. “The egg seems to get further away the more I walk towards it.\nLet me see, is this a chair? Why, it’s got branches, I declare! How very\nodd to find trees growing here! And actually here’s a little brook! Well,\nthis is the very queerest shop I ever saw!”\n</p>\n<p class=\"asterism\">\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n<br/>\n    *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n<br/>\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\nSo she went on, wondering more and more at every step, as everything turned\ninto a tree the moment she came up to it, and she quite expected the egg to do\nthe same.\n</p>"
