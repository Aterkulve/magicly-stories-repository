  "content": "<p>\nHowever, the egg only got larger and larger, and more and more human: when she\nhad come within a few yards of it, she saw that it had eyes and a nose and\nmouth; and when she had come close to it, she saw clearly that it was HUMPTY\nDUMPTY himself. “It can’t be anybody else!” she said to\nherself. “I’m as certain of it, as if his name were written all\nover his face.”\n</p>\n<p>\nIt might have been written a hundred times, easily, on that enormous face.\nHumpty Dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed, like a Turk, on the top of a\nhigh wall—such a narrow one that Alice quite wondered how he could keep\nhis balance—and, as his eyes were steadily fixed in the opposite\ndirection, and he didn’t take the least notice of her, she thought he\nmust be a stuffed figure after all.\n</p>\n<p>\n“And how exactly like an egg he is!” she said aloud, standing with\nher hands ready to catch him, for she was every moment expecting him to fall.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It’s <i>very</i> provoking,” Humpty Dumpty said after a long\nsilence, looking away from Alice as he spoke, “to be called an\negg—<i>Very!</i>”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I said you <i>looked</i> like an egg, Sir,” Alice gently\nexplained. “And some eggs are very pretty, you know” she added,\nhoping to turn her remark into a sort of a compliment.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Some people,” said Humpty Dumpty, looking away from her as usual,\n“have no more sense than a baby!”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice didn’t know what to say to this: it wasn’t at all like\nconversation, she thought, as he never said anything to <i>her</i>; in fact,\nhis last remark was evidently addressed to a tree—so she stood and softly\nrepeated to herself:—\n</p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n“Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall:<br/>\nHumpty Dumpty had a great fall.<br/>\nAll the King’s horses and all the King’s men<br/>\nCouldn’t put Humpty Dumpty in his place again.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“That last line is much too long for the poetry,” she added, almost\nout loud, forgetting that Humpty Dumpty would hear her.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Don’t stand there chattering to yourself like that,” Humpty\nDumpty said, looking at her for the first time, “but tell me your name\nand your business.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“My <i>name</i> is Alice, but—”\n</p>\n<p>\n“It’s a stupid enough name!” Humpty Dumpty interrupted\nimpatiently. “What does it mean?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“<i>Must</i> a name mean something?” Alice asked doubtfully.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Of course it must,” Humpty Dumpty said with a short laugh:\n“<i>my</i> name means the shape I am—and a good handsome shape it\nis, too. With a name like yours, you might be any shape, almost.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Why do you sit out here all alone?” said Alice, not wishing to\nbegin an argument.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Why, because there’s nobody with me!” cried Humpty Dumpty.\n“Did you think I didn’t know the answer to <i>that</i>? Ask\nanother.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Don’t you think you’d be safer down on the ground?”\nAlice went on, not with any idea of making another riddle, but simply in her\ngood-natured anxiety for the queer creature. “That wall is so <i>very</i>\nnarrow!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“What tremendously easy riddles you ask!” Humpty Dumpty growled\nout. “Of course I don’t think so! Why, if ever I <i>did</i> fall\noff—which there’s no chance of—but <i>if</i> I\ndid—” Here he pursed his lips and looked so solemn and grand that\nAlice could hardly help laughing. “<i>If</i> I did fall,” he went\non, “<i>The King has promised me—with his very own\nmouth</i>—to—to—”\n</p>\n<p>\n“To send all his horses and all his men,” Alice interrupted, rather\nunwisely.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Now I declare that’s too bad!” Humpty Dumpty cried, breaking\ninto a sudden passion. “You’ve been listening at doors—and\nbehind trees—and down chimneys—or you couldn’t have known\nit!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I haven’t, indeed!” Alice said very gently.\n“It’s in a book.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Ah, well! They may write such things in a <i>book</i>,” Humpty\nDumpty said in a calmer tone. “That’s what you call a History of\nEngland, that is. Now, take a good look at me! I’m one that has spoken to\na King, <i>I</i> am: mayhap you’ll never see such another: and to show\nyou I’m not proud, you may shake hands with me!” And he grinned\nalmost from ear to ear, as he leant forwards (and as nearly as possible fell\noff the wall in doing so) and offered Alice his hand. She watched him a little\nanxiously as she took it. “If he smiled much more, the ends of his mouth\nmight meet behind,” she thought: “and then I don’t know what\nwould happen to his head! I’m afraid it would come off!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Yes, all his horses and all his men,” Humpty Dumpty went on.\n“They’d pick me up again in a minute, <i>they</i> would! However,\nthis conversation is going on a little too fast: let’s go back to the\nlast remark but one.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’m afraid I can’t quite remember it,” Alice said very\npolitely.\n</p>\n<p>\n“In that case we start fresh,” said Humpty Dumpty, “and\nit’s my turn to choose a subject—” (“He talks about it\njust as if it was a game!” thought Alice.) “So here’s a\nquestion for you. How old did you say you were?”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice made a short calculation, and said “Seven years and six\nmonths.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Wrong!” Humpty Dumpty exclaimed triumphantly. “You never\nsaid a word like it!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I though you meant ‘How old <i>are</i> you?’” Alice\nexplained.\n</p>\n<p>\n“If I’d meant that, I’d have said it,” said Humpty\nDumpty.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice didn’t want to begin another argument, so she said nothing.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Seven years and six months!” Humpty Dumpty repeated thoughtfully.\n“An uncomfortable sort of age. Now if you’d asked <i>my</i> advice,\nI’d have said ‘Leave off at seven’—but it’s too\nlate now.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I never ask advice about growing,” Alice said indignantly.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Too proud?” the other inquired.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice felt even more indignant at this suggestion. “I mean,” she\nsaid, “that one can’t help growing older.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“<i>One</i> can’t, perhaps,” said Humpty Dumpty, “but\n<i>two</i> can. With proper assistance, you might have left off at\nseven.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“What a beautiful belt you’ve got on!” Alice suddenly\nremarked.\n</p>\n<p>\n(They had had quite enough of the subject of age, she thought: and if they\nreally were to take turns in choosing subjects, it was her turn now.) “At\nleast,” she corrected herself on second thoughts, “a beautiful\ncravat, I should have said—no, a belt, I mean—I beg your\npardon!” she added in dismay, for Humpty Dumpty looked thoroughly\noffended, and she began to wish she hadn’t chosen that subject. “If\nI only knew,” she thought to herself, “which was neck and which was\nwaist!”\n</p>\n<p>\nEvidently Humpty Dumpty was very angry, though he said nothing for a minute or\ntwo. When he <i>did</i> speak again, it was in a deep growl.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It is a—<i>most—provoking</i>—thing,” he said at\nlast, “when a person doesn’t know a cravat from a belt!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I know it’s very ignorant of me,” Alice said, in so humble a\ntone that Humpty Dumpty relented.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It’s a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say. It’s\na present from the White King and Queen. There now!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Is it really?” said Alice, quite pleased to find that she\n<i>had</i> chosen a good subject, after all.\n</p>\n<p>\n“They gave it me,” Humpty Dumpty continued thoughtfully, as he\ncrossed one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it, “they\ngave it me—for an un-birthday present.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I beg your pardon?” Alice said with a puzzled air.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’m not offended,” said Humpty Dumpty.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I mean, what <i>is</i> an un-birthday present?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“A present given when it isn’t your birthday, of course.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice considered a little. “I like birthday presents best,” she\nsaid at last.\n</p>\n<p>\n“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” cried\nHumpty Dumpty. “How many days are there in a year?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Three hundred and sixty-five,” said Alice.\n</p>\n<p>\n“And how many birthdays have you?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“One.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“And if you take one from three hundred and sixty-five, what\nremains?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Three hundred and sixty-four, of course.”\n</p>\n<p>\nHumpty Dumpty looked doubtful. “I’d rather see that done on\npaper,” he said.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice couldn’t help smiling as she took out her memorandum-book, and\nworked the sum for him:\n</p>\n<p class=\"letter\"> 365<br/>\n    1<br/>\n____<br/>\n364<br/>\n___\n</p>\n<p>\nHumpty Dumpty took the book, and looked at it carefully. “That seems to\nbe done right—” he began.\n</p>\n<p>\n“You’re holding it upside down!” Alice interrupted.\n</p>\n<p>\n“To be sure I was!” Humpty Dumpty said gaily, as she turned it\nround for him. “I thought it looked a little queer. As I was saying, that\n<i>seems</i> to be done right—though I haven’t time to look it over\nthoroughly just now—and that shows that there are three hundred and\nsixty-four days when you might get un-birthday presents—”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Certainly,” said Alice.\n</p>\n<p>\n“And only <i>one</i> for birthday presents, you know. There’s glory\nfor you!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I don’t know what you mean by ‘glory,’” Alice\nsaid.\n</p>\n<p>\nHumpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously. “Of course you\ndon’t—till I tell you. I meant ‘there’s a nice\nknock-down argument for you!’”\n</p>\n<p>\n“But ‘glory’ doesn’t mean ‘a nice knock-down\nargument,’” Alice objected.\n</p>\n<p>\n“When <i>I</i> use a word,” Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful\ntone, “it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor\nless.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“The question is,” said Alice, “whether you <i>can</i> make\nwords mean so many different things.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“The question is,” said Humpty Dumpty, “which is to be\nmaster—that’s all.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice was too much puzzled to say anything, so after a minute Humpty Dumpty\nbegan again. “They’ve a temper, some of them—particularly\nverbs, they’re the proudest—adjectives you can do anything with,\nbut not verbs—however, <i>I</i> can manage the whole lot of them!\nImpenetrability! That’s what <i>I</i> say!”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Would you tell me, please,” said Alice “what that\nmeans?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Now you talk like a reasonable child,” said Humpty Dumpty, looking\nvery much pleased. “I meant by ‘impenetrability’ that\nwe’ve had enough of that subject, and it would be just as well if\nyou’d mention what you mean to do next, as I suppose you don’t mean\nto stop here all the rest of your life.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“That’s a great deal to make one word mean,” Alice said in a\nthoughtful tone.\n</p>\n<p>\n“When I make a word do a lot of work like that,” said Humpty\nDumpty, “I always pay it extra.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Oh!” said Alice. She was too much puzzled to make any other\nremark.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Ah, you should see ’em come round me of a Saturday night,”\nHumpty Dumpty went on, wagging his head gravely from side to side: “for\nto get their wages, you know.”\n</p>\n<p>\n(Alice didn’t venture to ask what he paid them with; and so you see I\ncan’t tell <i>you</i>.)\n</p>\n<p>\n“You seem very clever at explaining words, Sir,” said Alice.\n“Would you kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called\n‘Jabberwocky’?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Let’s hear it,” said Humpty Dumpty. “I can explain all\nthe poems that were ever invented—and a good many that haven’t been\ninvented just yet.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThis sounded very hopeful, so Alice repeated the first verse:\n</p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br/>\n    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br/>\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,<br/>\n    And the mome raths outgrabe.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That’s enough to begin with,” Humpty Dumpty interrupted:\n“there are plenty of hard words there. ‘<i>Brillig</i>’ means\nfour o’clock in the afternoon—the time when you begin\n<i>broiling</i> things for dinner.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“That’ll do very well,” said Alice: “and\n‘<i>slithy</i>’?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well, ‘<i>slithy</i>’ means ‘lithe and slimy.’\n‘Lithe’ is the same as ‘active.’ You see it’s\nlike a portmanteau—there are two meanings packed up into one word.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I see it now,” Alice remarked thoughtfully: “and what are\n‘<i>toves</i>’?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well, ‘<i>toves</i>’ are something like\nbadgers—they’re something like lizards—and they’re\nsomething like corkscrews.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“They must be very curious looking creatures.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“They are that,” said Humpty Dumpty: “also they make their\nnests under sun-dials—also they live on cheese.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“And what’s the ‘<i>gyre</i>’ and to\n‘<i>gimble</i>’?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“To ‘<i>gyre</i>’ is to go round and round like a gyroscope.\nTo ‘<i>gimble</i>’ is to make holes like a gimlet.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“And ‘<i>the wabe</i>’ is the grass-plot round a sun-dial, I\nsuppose?” said Alice, surprised at her own ingenuity.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Of course it is. It’s called ‘<i>wabe</i>,’ you know,\nbecause it goes a long way before it, and a long way behind it—”\n</p>\n<p>\n“And a long way beyond it on each side,” Alice added.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Exactly so. Well, then, ‘<i>mimsy</i>’ is ‘flimsy and\nmiserable’ (there’s another portmanteau for you). And a\n‘<i>borogove</i>’ is a thin shabby-looking bird with its feathers\nsticking out all round—something like a live mop.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“And then ‘<i>mome raths</i>’?” said Alice.\n“I’m afraid I’m giving you a great deal of trouble.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well, a ‘<i>rath</i>’ is a sort of green pig: but\n‘<i>mome</i>’ I’m not certain about. I think it’s short\nfor ‘from home’—meaning that they’d lost their way, you\nknow.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“And what does ‘<i>outgrabe</i>’ mean?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well, ‘<i>outgrabing</i>’ is something between bellowing and\nwhistling, with a kind of sneeze in the middle: however, you’ll hear it\ndone, maybe—down in the wood yonder—and when you’ve once\nheard it you’ll be <i>quite</i> content. Who’s been repeating all\nthat hard stuff to you?”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I read it in a book,” said Alice. “But I had some poetry\nrepeated to me, much easier than that, by—Tweedledee, I think it\nwas.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“As to poetry, you know,” said Humpty Dumpty, stretching out one of\nhis great hands, “<i>I</i> can repeat poetry as well as other folk, if it\ncomes to that—”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Oh, it needn’t come to that!” Alice hastily said, hoping to\nkeep him from beginning.\n</p>\n<p>\n“The piece I’m going to repeat,” he went on without noticing\nher remark, “was written entirely for your amusement.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice felt that in that case she really <i>ought</i> to listen to it, so she\nsat down, and said “Thank you” rather sadly.\n</p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n“In winter, when the fields are white,<br/>\nI sing this song for your delight—\n</p>\n<p>\nonly I don’t sing it,” he added, as an explanation.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I see you don’t,” said Alice.\n</p>\n<p>\n“If you can <i>see</i> whether I’m singing or not, you’ve\nsharper eyes than most.” Humpty Dumpty remarked severely. Alice was\nsilent.\n</p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n“In spring, when woods are getting green,<br/>\nI’ll try and tell you what I mean.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“Thank you very much,” said Alice.\n</p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n“In summer, when the days are long,<br/>\nPerhaps you’ll understand the song:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn autumn, when the leaves are brown,<br/>\nTake pen and ink, and write it down.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I will, if I can remember it so long,” said Alice.\n</p>\n<p>\n“You needn’t go on making remarks like that,” Humpty Dumpty\nsaid: “they’re not sensible, and they put me out.”\n</p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n“I sent a message to the fish:<br/>\nI told them ‘This is what I wish.’<br/>\n<br/>\nThe little fishes of the sea,<br/>\nThey sent an answer back to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe little fishes’ answer was<br/>\n‘We cannot do it, Sir, because—’”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’m afraid I don’t quite understand,” said Alice.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It gets easier further on,” Humpty Dumpty replied.\n</p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n“I sent to them again to say<br/>\n‘It will be better to obey.’<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fishes answered with a grin,<br/>\n‘Why, what a temper you are in!’<br/>\n<br/>\nI told them once, I told them twice:<br/>\nThey would not listen to advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took a kettle large and new,<br/>\nFit for the deed I had to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy heart went hop, my heart went thump;<br/>\nI filled the kettle at the pump.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen some one came to me and said,<br/>\n‘The little fishes are in bed.’<br/>\n<br/>\nI said to him, I said it plain,<br/>\n‘Then you must wake them up again.’<br/>\n<br/>\nI said it very loud and clear;<br/>\nI went and shouted in his ear.”\n</p>\n<p>\nHumpty Dumpty raised his voice almost to a scream as he repeated this verse,\nand Alice thought with a shudder, “I wouldn’t have been the\nmessenger for <i>anything</i>!”\n</p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n“But he was very stiff and proud;<br/>\nHe said ‘You needn’t shout so loud!’<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he was very proud and stiff;<br/>\nHe said ‘I’d go and wake them, if—’<br/>\n<br/>\nI took a corkscrew from the shelf:<br/>\nI went to wake them up myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when I found the door was locked,<br/>\nI pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when I found the door was shut,<br/>\nI tried to turn the handle, but—”\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was a long pause.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Is that all?” Alice timidly asked.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That’s all,” said Humpty Dumpty. “Good-bye.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThis was rather sudden, Alice thought: but, after such a <i>very</i> strong\nhint that she ought to be going, she felt that it would hardly be civil to\nstay. So she got up, and held out her hand. “Good-bye, till we meet\nagain!” she said as cheerfully as she could.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I shouldn’t know you again if we <i>did</i> meet,” Humpty\nDumpty replied in a discontented tone, giving her one of his fingers to shake;\n“you’re so exactly like other people.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“The face is what one goes by, generally,” Alice remarked in a\nthoughtful tone.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That’s just what I complain of,” said Humpty Dumpty.\n“Your face is the same as everybody has—the two eyes,\nso—” (marking their places in the air with this thumb) “nose\nin the middle, mouth under. It’s always the same. Now if you had the two\neyes on the same side of the nose, for instance—or the mouth at the\ntop—that would be <i>some</i> help.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“It wouldn’t look nice,” Alice objected. But Humpty Dumpty\nonly shut his eyes and said “Wait till you’ve tried.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice waited a minute to see if he would speak again, but as he never opened\nhis eyes or took any further notice of her, she said “Good-bye!”\nonce more, and, getting no answer to this, she quietly walked away: but she\ncouldn’t help saying to herself as she went, “Of all the\nunsatisfactory—” (she repeated this aloud, as it was a great\ncomfort to have such a long word to say) “of all the unsatisfactory\npeople I <i>ever</i> met—” She never finished the sentence, for at\nthis moment a heavy crash shook the forest from end to end.\n</p>"
