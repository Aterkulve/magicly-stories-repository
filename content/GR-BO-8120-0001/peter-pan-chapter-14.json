  "content": "<p>The more quickly this horror is disposed of the better. The first to emerge\nfrom his tree was Curly. He rose out of it into the arms of Cecco, who flung\nhim to Smee, who flung him to Starkey, who flung him to Bill Jukes, who flung\nhim to Noodler, and so he was tossed from one to another till he fell at the\nfeet of the black pirate. All the boys were plucked from their trees in this\nruthless manner; and several of them were in the air at a time, like bales of\ngoods flung from hand to hand.</p>\n<p>A different treatment was accorded to Wendy, who came last. With ironical\npoliteness Hook raised his hat to her, and, offering her his arm, escorted her\nto the spot where the others were being gagged. He did it with such an air, he\nwas so frightfullydistingué, that she was too fascinated to cry out.\nShe was only a little girl.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment Hook entranced her, and we\ntell on her only because her slip led to strange results. Had she haughtily\nunhanded him (and we should have loved to write it of her), she would have been\nhurled through the air like the others, and then Hook would probably not have\nbeen present at the tying of the children; and had he not been at the tying he\nwould not have discovered Slightly’s secret, and without the secret he\ncould not presently have made his foul attempt on Peter’s life.</p>\n<p>They were tied to prevent their flying away, doubled up with their knees close\nto their ears; and for the trussing of them the black pirate had cut a rope\ninto nine equal pieces. All went well until Slightly’s turn came, when he\nwas found to be like those irritating parcels that use up all the string in\ngoing round and leave no tags with which to tie a knot. The pirates kicked him\nin their rage, just as you kick the parcel (though in fairness you should kick\nthe string); and strange to say it was Hook who told them to belay their\nviolence. His lip was curled with malicious triumph. While his dogs were merely\nsweating because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in one\npart he bulged out in another, Hook’s master mind had gone far beneath\nSlightly’s surface, probing not for effects but for causes; and his\nexultation showed that he had found them. Slightly, white to the gills, knew\nthat Hook had surprised his secret, which was this, that no boy so blown out\ncould use a tree wherein an average man need stick. Poor Slightly, most\nwretched of all the children now, for he was in a panic about Peter, bitterly\nregretted what he had done. Madly addicted to the drinking of water when he was\nhot, he had swelled in consequence to his present girth, and instead of\nreducing himself to fit his tree he had, unknown to the others, whittled his\ntree to make it fit him.</p>\n<p>Sufficient of this Hook guessed to persuade him that Peter at last lay at his\nmercy, but no word of the dark design that now formed in the subterranean\ncaverns of his mind crossed his lips; he merely signed that the captives were\nto be conveyed to the ship, and that he would be alone.</p>\n<p>How to convey them? Hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be rolled down\nhill like barrels, but most of the way lay through a morass. Again Hook’s\ngenius surmounted difficulties. He indicated that the little house must be used\nas a conveyance. The children were flung into it, four stout pirates raised it\non their shoulders, the others fell in behind, and singing the hateful pirate\nchorus the strange procession set off through the wood. I don’t know\nwhether any of the children were crying; if so, the singing drowned the sound;\nbut as the little house disappeared in the forest, a brave though tiny jet of\nsmoke issued from its chimney as if defying Hook.</p>\n<p>Hook saw it, and it did Peter a bad service. It dried up any trickle of pity\nfor him that may have remained in the pirate’s infuriated breast.</p>\n<p>The first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling night was\nto tiptoe to Slightly’s tree, and make sure that it provided him with a\npassage. Then for long he remained brooding; his hat of ill omen on the sward,\nso that any gentle breeze which had arisen might play refreshingly through his\nhair. Dark as were his thoughts his blue eyes were as soft as the periwinkle.\nIntently he listened for any sound from the nether world, but all was as silent\nbelow as above; the house under the ground seemed to be but one more empty\ntenement in the void. Was that boy asleep, or did he stand waiting at the foot\nof Slightly’s tree, with his dagger in his hand?</p>\n<p>There was no way of knowing, save by going down. Hook let his cloak slip softly\nto the ground, and then biting his lips till a lewd blood stood on them, he\nstepped into the tree. He was a brave man, but for a moment he had to stop\nthere and wipe his brow, which was dripping like a candle. Then, silently, he\nlet himself go into the unknown.</p>\n<p>He arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again, biting\nat his breath, which had almost left him. As his eyes became accustomed to the\ndim light various objects in the home under the trees took shape; but the only\none on which his greedy gaze rested, long sought for and found at last, was the\ngreat bed. On the bed lay Peter fast asleep.</p>\n<p>Unaware of the tragedy being enacted above, Peter had continued, for a little\ntime after the children left, to play gaily on his pipes: no doubt rather a\nforlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not care. Then he decided not\nto take his medicine, so as to grieve Wendy. Then he lay down on the bed\noutside the coverlet, to vex her still more; for she had always tucked them\ninside it, because you never know that you may not grow chilly at the turn of\nthe night. Then he nearly cried; but it struck him how indignant she would be\nif he laughed instead; so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the\nmiddle of it.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, though not often, he had dreams, and they were more painful than the\ndreams of other boys. For hours he could not be separated from these dreams,\nthough he wailed piteously in them. They had to do, I think, with the riddle of\nhis existence. At such times it had been Wendy’s custom to take him out\nof bed and sit with him on her lap, soothing him in dear ways of her own\ninvention, and when he grew calmer to put him back to bed before he quite woke\nup, so that he should not know of the indignity to which she had subjected him.\nBut on this occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. One arm\ndropped over the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part\nof his laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the little\npearls.</p>\n<p>Thus defenceless Hook found him. He stood silent at the foot of the tree\nlooking across the chamber at his enemy. Did no feeling of compassion disturb\nhis sombre breast? The man was not wholly evil; he loved flowers (I have been\ntold) and sweet music (he was himself no mean performer on the harpsichord);\nand, let it be frankly admitted, the idyllic nature of the scene stirred him\nprofoundly. Mastered by his better self he would have returned reluctantly up\nthe tree, but for one thing.</p>\n<p>What stayed him was Peter’s impertinent appearance as he slept. The open\nmouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: they were such a personification of\ncockiness as, taken together, will never again, one may hope, be presented to\neyes so sensitive to their offensiveness. They steeled Hook’s heart. If\nhis rage had broken him into a hundred pieces every one of them would have\ndisregarded the incident, and leapt at the sleeper.</p>\n<p>Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook stood in darkness\nhimself, and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered an obstacle, the\ndoor of Slightly’s tree. It did not entirely fill the aperture, and he\nhad been looking over it. Feeling for the catch, he found to his fury that it\nwas low down, beyond his reach. To his disordered brain it seemed then that the\nirritating quality in Peter’s face and figure visibly increased, and he\nrattled the door and flung himself against it. Was his enemy to escape him\nafter all?</p>\n<p>But what was that? The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter’s\nmedicine standing on a ledge within easy reach. He fathomed what it was\nstraightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power.</p>\n<p>Lest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his person a dreadful\ndrug, blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that had come into his\npossession. These he had boiled down into a yellow liquid quite unknown to\nscience, which was probably the most virulent poison in existence.</p>\n<p>Five drops of this he now added to Peter’s cup. His hand shook, but it\nwas in exultation rather than in shame. As he did it he avoided glancing at the\nsleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve him; merely to avoid spilling. Then\none long gloating look he cast upon his victim, and turning, wormed his way\nwith difficulty up the tree. As he emerged at the top he looked the very spirit\nof evil breaking from its hole. Donning his hat at its most rakish angle, he\nwound his cloak around him, holding one end in front as if to conceal his\nperson from the night, of which it was the blackest part, and muttering\nstrangely to himself, stole away through the trees.</p>\n<p>Peter slept on. The light guttered and went out, leaving the tenement in\ndarkness; but still he slept. It must have been not less than ten o’clock\nby the crocodile, when he suddenly sat up in his bed, wakened by he knew not\nwhat. It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree.</p>\n<p>Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister. Peter felt for his\ndagger till his hand gripped it. Then he spoke.</p>\n<p>“Who is that?”</p>\n<p>For long there was no answer: then again the knock.</p>\n<p>“Who are you?”</p>\n<p>No answer.</p>\n<p>He was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled. In two strides he reached the\ndoor. Unlike Slightly’s door, it filled the aperture, so that he could\nnot see beyond it, nor could the one knocking see him.</p>\n<p>“I won’t open unless you speak,” Peter cried.</p>\n<p>Then at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice.</p>\n<p>“Let me in, Peter.”</p>\n<p>It was Tink, and quickly he unbarred to her. She flew in excitedly, her face\nflushed and her dress stained with mud.</p>\n<p>“What is it?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you could never guess!” she cried, and offered him three\nguesses. “Out with it!” he shouted, and in one ungrammatical\nsentence, as long as the ribbons that conjurers pull from their mouths, she\ntold of the capture of Wendy and the boys.</p>\n<p>Peter’s heart bobbed up and down as he listened. Wendy bound, and on the\npirate ship; she who loved everything to be just so!</p>\n<p>“I’ll rescue her!” he cried, leaping at his weapons. As he\nleapt he thought of something he could do to please her. He could take his\nmedicine.</p>\n<p>His hand closed on the fatal draught.</p>\n<p>“No!” shrieked Tinker Bell, who had heard Hook mutter about his\ndeed as he sped through the forest.</p>\n<p>“Why not?”</p>\n<p>“It is poisoned.”</p>\n<p>“Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?”</p>\n<p>“Hook.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t be silly. How could Hook have got down here?”</p>\n<p>Alas, Tinker Bell could not explain this, for even she did not know the dark\nsecret of Slightly’s tree. Nevertheless Hook’s words had left no\nroom for doubt. The cup was poisoned.</p>\n<p>“Besides,” said Peter, quite believing himself, “I never fell\nasleep.”</p>\n<p>He raised the cup. No time for words now; time for deeds; and with one of her\nlightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught, and drained it\nto the dregs.</p>\n<p>“Why, Tink, how dare you drink my medicine?”</p>\n<p>But she did not answer. Already she was reeling in the air.</p>\n<p>“What is the matter with you?” cried Peter, suddenly afraid.</p>\n<p>“It was poisoned, Peter,” she told him softly; “and now I am\ngoing to be dead.”</p>\n<p>“O Tink, did you drink it to save me?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“But why, Tink?”</p>\n<p>Her wings would scarcely carry her now, but in reply she alighted on his\nshoulder and gave his nose a loving bite. She whispered in his ear “You\nsilly ass,” and then, tottering to her chamber, lay down on the bed.</p>\n<p>His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt near her\nin distress. Every moment her light was growing fainter; and he knew that if it\nwent out she would be no more. She liked his tears so much that she put out her\nbeautiful finger and let them run over it.</p>\n<p>Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said. Then he\nmade it out. She was saying that she thought she could get well again if\nchildren believed in fairies.</p>\n<p>Peter flung out his arms. There were no children there, and it was night time;\nbut he addressed all who might be dreaming of the Neverland, and who were\ntherefore nearer to him than you think: boys and girls in their nighties, and\nnaked papooses in their baskets hung from trees.</p>\n<p>“Do you believe?” he cried.</p>\n<p>Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate.</p>\n<p>She fancied she heard answers in the affirmative, and then again she\nwasn’t sure.</p>\n<p>“What do you think?” she asked Peter.</p>\n<p>“If you believe,” he shouted to them, “clap your hands;\ndon’t let Tink die.”</p>\n<p>Many clapped.</p>\n<p>Some didn’t.</p>\n<p>A few beasts hissed.</p>\n<p>The clapping stopped suddenly; as if countless mothers had rushed to their\nnurseries to see what on earth was happening; but already Tink was saved. First\nher voice grew strong, then she popped out of bed, then she was flashing\nthrough the room more merry and impudent than ever. She never thought of\nthanking those who believed, but she would have liked to get at the ones who\nhad hissed.</p>\n<p>“And now to rescue Wendy!”</p>\n<p>The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree, begirt\nwith weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon his perilous quest. It\nwas not such a night as he would have chosen. He had hoped to fly, keeping not\nfar from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape his eyes; but in\nthat fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing his shadow\nthrough the trees, thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he\nwas astir.</p>\n<p>He regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange names\nthat they are very wild and difficult of approach.</p>\n<p>There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at which\nhappily he was an adept. But in what direction, for he could not be sure that\nthe children had been taken to the ship? A light fall of snow had obliterated\nall footmarks; and a deathly silence pervaded the island, as if for a space\nNature stood still in horror of the recent carnage. He had taught the children\nsomething of the forest lore that he had himself learned from Tiger Lily and\nTinker Bell, and knew that in their dire hour they were not likely to forget\nit. Slightly, if he had an opportunity, would blaze the trees, for instance,\nCurly would drop seeds, and Wendy would leave her handkerchief at some\nimportant place. The morning was needed to search for such guidance, and he\ncould not wait. The upper world had called him, but would give no help.</p>\n<p>The crocodile passed him, but not another living thing, not a sound, not a\nmovement; and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the next tree, or\nstalking him from behind.</p>\n<p>He swore this terrible oath: “Hook or me this time.”</p>\n<p>Now he crawled forward like a snake, and again erect, he darted across a space\non which the moonlight played, one finger on his lip and his dagger at the\nready. He was frightfully happy.</p>"
