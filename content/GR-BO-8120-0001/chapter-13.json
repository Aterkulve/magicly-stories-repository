  "content": "<p>The pirate attack had been a complete surprise: a sure proof that the\nunscrupulous Hook had conducted it improperly, for to surprise redskins fairly\nis beyond the wit of the white man.</p>\n<p>By all the unwritten laws of savage warfare it is always the redskin who\nattacks, and with the wiliness of his race he does it just before the dawn, at\nwhich time he knows the courage of the whites to be at its lowest ebb. The\nwhite men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on the summit of yonder\nundulating ground, at the foot of which a stream runs, for it is destruction to\nbe too far from water. There they await the onslaught, the inexperienced ones\nclutching their revolvers and treading on twigs, but the old hands sleeping\ntranquilly until just before the dawn. Through the long black night the savage\nscouts wriggle, snake-like, among the grass without stirring a blade. The\nbrushwood closes behind them, as silently as sand into which a mole has dived.\nNot a sound is to be heard, save when they give vent to a wonderful imitation\nof the lonely call of the coyote. The cry is answered by other braves; and some\nof them do it even better than the coyotes, who are not very good at it. So the\nchill hours wear on, and the long suspense is horribly trying to the paleface\nwho has to live through it for the first time; but to the trained hand those\nghastly calls and still ghastlier silences are but an intimation of how the\nnight is marching.</p>\n<p>That this was the usual procedure was so well known to Hook that in\ndisregarding it he cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance.</p>\n<p>The Piccaninnies, on their part, trusted implicitly to his honour, and their\nwhole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his. They left\nnothing undone that was consistent with the reputation of their tribe. With\nthat alertness of the senses which is at once the marvel and despair of\ncivilised peoples, they knew that the pirates were on the island from the\nmoment one of them trod on a dry stick; and in an incredibly short space of\ntime the coyote cries began. Every foot of ground between the spot where Hook\nhad landed his forces and the home under the trees was stealthily examined by\nbraves wearing their mocassins with the heels in front. They found only one\nhillock with a stream at its base, so that Hook had no choice; here he must\nestablish himself and wait for just before the dawn. Everything being thus\nmapped out with almost diabolical cunning, the main body of the redskins folded\ntheir blankets around them, and in the phlegmatic manner that is to them, the\npearl of manhood squatted above the children’s home, awaiting the cold\nmoment when they should deal pale death.</p>\n<p>Here dreaming, though wide-awake, of the exquisite tortures to which they were\nto put him at break of day, those confiding savages were found by the\ntreacherous Hook. From the accounts afterwards supplied by such of the scouts\nas escaped the carnage, he does not seem even to have paused at the rising\nground, though it is certain that in that grey light he must have seen it: no\nthought of waiting to be attacked appears from first to last to have visited\nhis subtle mind; he would not even hold off till the night was nearly spent; on\nhe pounded with no policy but to fall to. What could the bewildered scouts do,\nmasters as they were of every war-like artifice save this one, but trot\nhelplessly after him, exposing themselves fatally to view, while they gave\npathetic utterance to the coyote cry.</p>\n<p>Around the brave Tiger Lily were a dozen of her stoutest warriors, and they\nsuddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down upon them. Fell from their\neyes then the film through which they had looked at victory. No more would they\ntorture at the stake. For them the happy hunting-grounds was now. They knew it;\nbut as their father’s sons they acquitted themselves. Even then they had\ntime to gather in a phalanx that would have been hard to break had they risen\nquickly, but this they were forbidden to do by the traditions of their race. It\nis written that the noble savage must never express surprise in the presence of\nthe white. Thus terrible as the sudden appearance of the pirates must have been\nto them, they remained stationary for a moment, not a muscle moving; as if the\nfoe had come by invitation. Then, indeed, the tradition gallantly upheld, they\nseized their weapons, and the air was torn with the war-cry; but it was now too\nlate.</p>\n<p>It is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a fight. Thus\nperished many of the flower of the Piccaninny tribe. Not all unavenged did they\ndie, for with Lean Wolf fell Alf Mason, to disturb the Spanish Main no more,\nand among others who bit the dust were Geo. Scourie, Chas. Turley, and the\nAlsatian Foggerty. Turley fell to the tomahawk of the terrible Panther, who\nultimately cut a way through the pirates with Tiger Lily and a small remnant of\nthe tribe.</p>\n<p>To what extent Hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is for the\nhistorian to decide. Had he waited on the rising ground till the proper hour he\nand his men would probably have been butchered; and in judging him it is only\nfair to take this into account. What he should perhaps have done was to\nacquaint his opponents that he proposed to follow a new method. On the other\nhand, this, as destroying the element of surprise, would have made his strategy\nof no avail, so that the whole question is beset with difficulties. One cannot\nat least withhold a reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold\na scheme, and the fell genius with which it was carried out.</p>\n<p>What were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment? Fain would\nhis dogs have known, as breathing heavily and wiping their cutlasses, they\ngathered at a discreet distance from his hook, and squinted through their\nferret eyes at this extraordinary man. Elation must have been in his heart, but\nhis face did not reflect it: ever a dark and solitary enigma, he stood aloof\nfrom his followers in spirit as in substance.</p>\n<p>The night’s work was not yet over, for it was not the redskins he had\ncome out to destroy; they were but the bees to be smoked, so that he should get\nat the honey. It was Pan he wanted, Pan and Wendy and their band, but chiefly\nPan.</p>\n<p>Peter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man’s hatred\nof him. True he had flung Hook’s arm to the crocodile, but even this and\nthe increased insecurity of life to which it led, owing to the\ncrocodile’s pertinacity, hardly account for a vindictiveness so\nrelentless and malignant. The truth is that there was a something about Peter\nwhich goaded the pirate captain to frenzy. It was not his courage, it was not\nhis engaging appearance, it was not—. There is no beating about the bush,\nfor we know quite well what it was, and have got to tell. It was Peter’s\ncockiness.</p>\n<p>This had got on Hook’s nerves; it made his iron claw twitch, and at night\nit disturbed him like an insect. While Peter lived, the tortured man felt that\nhe was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come.</p>\n<p>The question now was how to get down the trees, or how to get his dogs down? He\nran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest ones. They wriggled\nuncomfortably, for they knew he would not scruple to ram them down with poles.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, what of the boys? We have seen them at the first clang of the\nweapons, turned as it were into stone figures, open-mouthed, all appealing with\noutstretched arms to Peter; and we return to them as their mouths close, and\ntheir arms fall to their sides. The pandemonium above has ceased almost as\nsuddenly as it arose, passed like a fierce gust of wind; but they know that in\nthe passing it has determined their fate.</p>\n<p>Which side had won?</p>\n<p>The pirates, listening avidly at the mouths of the trees, heard the question\nput by every boy, and alas, they also heard Peter’s answer.</p>\n<p>“If the redskins have won,” he said, “they will beat the\ntom-tom; it is always their sign of victory.”</p>\n<p>Now Smee had found the tom-tom, and was at that moment sitting on it.\n“You will never hear the tom-tom again,” he muttered, but inaudibly\nof course, for strict silence had been enjoined. To his amazement Hook signed\nhim to beat the tom-tom, and slowly there came to Smee an understanding of the\ndreadful wickedness of the order. Never, probably, had this simple man admired\nHook so much.</p>\n<p>Twice Smee beat upon the instrument, and then stopped to listen gleefully.</p>\n<p>“The tom-tom,” the miscreants heard Peter cry; “an Indian\nvictory!”</p>\n<p>The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black hearts\nabove, and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes to Peter. This\npuzzled the pirates, but all their other feelings were swallowed by a base\ndelight that the enemy were about to come up the trees. They smirked at each\nother and rubbed their hands. Rapidly and silently Hook gave his orders: one\nman to each tree, and the others to arrange themselves in a line two yards\napart.</p>"
