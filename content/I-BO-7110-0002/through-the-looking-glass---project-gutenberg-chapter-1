  "content": "<p>Looking-Glass House</p>\n<p>One thing was certain, that the</p>\n<p>white</p>\n<p>kitten had had nothing to do with</p>\n<p>it:—it was the black kitten’s fault entirely. For the white kitten had been</p>\n<p>having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour (and</p>\n<p>bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it</p>\n<p>couldn’t</p>\n<p>have</p>\n<p>had any hand in the mischief.</p>\n<p>The way Dinah washed her children’s faces was this: first she held the</p>\n<p>poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she rubbed</p>\n<p>its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and just now, as I</p>\n<p>said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was lying quite still and</p>\n<p>trying to purr—no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good.</p>\n<p>But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon, and so,</p>\n<p>while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great arm-chair, half</p>\n<p>talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been having a grand game of</p>\n<p>romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been trying to wind up, and had been</p>\n<p>rolling it up and down till it had all come undone again; and there it was,</p>\n<p>spread over the hearth-rug, all knots and tangles, with the kitten running</p>\n<p>after its own tail in the middle.</p>\n<p>“Oh, you wicked little thing!” cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and giving</p>\n<p>it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. “Really, Dinah</p>\n<p>ought to have taught you better manners! You</p>\n<p>ought</p>\n<p>, Dinah, you know you</p>\n<p>ought!” she added, looking reproachfully at the old cat, and speaking in as</p>\n<p>cross a voice as she could manage—and then she scrambled back into the</p>\n<p>arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted with her, and began winding up the</p>\n<p>ball again. But she didn’t get on very fast, as she was talking all the time,</p>\n<p>sometimes to the kitten, and sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on</p>\n<p>her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then</p>\n<p>putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to</p>\n<p>help, if it might.</p>\n<p>“Do you know what to-morrow is, Kitty?” Alice began.</p>\n<p>“You’d have guessed if you’d been up in the window with</p>\n<p>me—only Dinah was making you tidy, so you couldn’t. I was watching</p>\n<p>the boys getting in sticks for the bonfire—and it wants plenty of sticks,</p>\n<p>Kitty! Only it got so cold, and it snowed so, they had to leave off. Never</p>\n<p>mind, Kitty, we’ll go and see the bonfire to-morrow.” Here Alice</p>\n<p>wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kitten’s neck, just to</p>\n<p>see how it would look: this led to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down</p>\n<p>upon the floor, and yards and yards of it got unwound again.</p>\n<p>“Do you know, I was so angry, Kitty,” Alice went on as soon as they</p>\n<p>were comfortably settled again, “when I saw all the mischief you had been</p>\n<p>doing, I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into the snow!</p>\n<p>And you’d have deserved it, you little mischievous darling! What have you</p>\n<p>got to say for yourself? Now don’t interrupt me!” she went on,</p>\n<p>holding up one finger. “I’m going to tell you all your faults.</p>\n<p>Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this morning.</p>\n<p>Now you can’t deny it, Kitty: I heard you! What’s that you</p>\n<p>say?” (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) “Her paw went into</p>\n<p>your eye? Well, that’s</p>\n<p>your</p>\n<p>fault, for keeping your eyes</p>\n<p>open—if you’d shut them tight up, it wouldn’t have happened.</p>\n<p>Now don’t make any more excuses, but listen! Number two: you pulled</p>\n<p>Snowdrop away by the tail just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her!</p>\n<p>What, you were thirsty, were you? How do you know she wasn’t thirsty too?</p>\n<p>Now for number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasn’t</p>\n<p>looking!</p>\n<p>“That’s three faults, Kitty, and you’ve not been punished for</p>\n<p>any of them yet. You know I’m saving up all your punishments for</p>\n<p>Wednesday week—Suppose they had saved up all</p>\n<p>my</p>\n<p>punishments!” she went on, talking more to herself than the kitten.</p>\n<p>“What</p>\n<p>would</p>\n<p>they do at the end of a year? I should be sent to</p>\n<p>prison, I suppose, when the day came. Or—let me see—suppose each</p>\n<p>punishment was to be going without a dinner: then, when the miserable day came,</p>\n<p>I should have to go without fifty dinners at once! Well, I shouldn’t mind</p>\n<p>that</p>\n<p>much! I’d far rather go without them than eat them!</p>\n<p>“Do you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty? How nice and soft</p>\n<p>it sounds! Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside. I</p>\n<p>wonder if the snow</p>\n<p>loves</p>\n<p>the trees and fields, that it kisses them so</p>\n<p>gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt; and</p>\n<p>perhaps it says, ‘Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes</p>\n<p>again.’ And when they wake up in the summer, Kitty, they dress themselves</p>\n<p>all in green, and dance about—whenever the wind blows—oh,</p>\n<p>that’s very pretty!” cried Alice, dropping the ball of worsted to</p>\n<p>clap her hands. “And I do so</p>\n<p>wish</p>\n<p>it was true! I’m sure the</p>\n<p>woods look sleepy in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown.</p>\n<p>“Kitty, can you play chess? Now, don’t smile, my dear, I’m</p>\n<p>asking it seriously. Because, when we were playing just now, you watched just</p>\n<p>as if you understood it: and when I said ‘Check!’ you purred! Well,</p>\n<p>it</p>\n<p>was</p>\n<p>a nice check, Kitty, and really I might have won, if it</p>\n<p>hadn’t been for that nasty Knight, that came wiggling down among my</p>\n<p>pieces. Kitty, dear, let’s pretend—” And here I wish I could</p>\n<p>tell you half the things Alice used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase</p>\n<p>“Let’s pretend.” She had had quite a long argument with her</p>\n<p>sister only the day before—all because Alice had begun with</p>\n<p>“Let’s pretend we’re kings and queens;” and her sister,</p>\n<p>who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldn’t, because there</p>\n<p>were only two of them, and Alice had been reduced at last to say, “Well,</p>\n<p>you</p>\n<p>can be one of them then, and</p>\n<p>I’ll</p>\n<p>be all the</p>\n<p>rest.” And once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting</p>\n<p>suddenly in her ear, “Nurse! Do let’s pretend that I’m a</p>\n<p>hungry hyaena, and you’re a bone.”</p>\n<p>But this is taking us away from Alice’s speech to the kitten. “Let’s pretend</p>\n<p>that you’re the Red Queen, Kitty! Do you know, I think if you sat up and folded</p>\n<p>your arms, you’d look exactly like her. Now do try, there’s a dear!” And Alice</p>\n<p>got the Red Queen off the table, and set it up before the kitten as a model for</p>\n<p>it to imitate: however, the thing didn’t succeed, principally, Alice said,</p>\n<p>because the kitten wouldn’t fold its arms properly. So, to punish it, she held</p>\n<p>it up to the Looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was—“and if you’re</p>\n<p>not good directly,” she added, “I’ll put you through into Looking-glass House.</p>\n<p>How would you like</p>\n<p>that</p>\n<p>?”</p>\n<p>“Now, if you’ll only attend, Kitty, and not talk so much,</p>\n<p>I’ll tell you all my ideas about Looking-glass House. First,</p>\n<p>there’s the room you can see through the glass—that’s just</p>\n<p>the same as our drawing room, only the things go the other way. I can see all</p>\n<p>of it when I get upon a chair—all but the bit behind the fireplace. Oh! I</p>\n<p>do so wish I could see</p>\n<p>that</p>\n<p>bit! I want so much to know whether</p>\n<p>they’ve a fire in the winter: you never</p>\n<p>can</p>\n<p>tell, you know, unless</p>\n<p>our fire smokes, and then smoke comes up in that room too—but that may be</p>\n<p>only pretence, just to make it look as if they had a fire. Well then, the books</p>\n<p>are something like our books, only the words go the wrong way; I know that,</p>\n<p>because I’ve held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold up</p>\n<p>one in the other room.</p>\n<p>“How would you like to live in Looking-glass House, Kitty? I wonder if</p>\n<p>they’d give you milk in there? Perhaps Looking-glass milk isn’t</p>\n<p>good to drink—But oh, Kitty! now we come to the passage. You can just see</p>\n<p>a little</p>\n<p>peep</p>\n<p>of the passage in Looking-glass House, if you leave the</p>\n<p>door of our drawing-room wide open: and it’s very like our passage as far</p>\n<p>as you can see, only you know it may be quite different on beyond. Oh, Kitty!</p>\n<p>how nice it would be if we could only get through into Looking-glass House!</p>\n<p>I’m sure it’s got, oh! such beautiful things in it! Let’s</p>\n<p>pretend there’s a way of getting through into it, somehow, Kitty.</p>\n<p>Let’s pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, so that we can get</p>\n<p>through. Why, it’s turning into a sort of mist now, I declare!</p>\n<p>It’ll be easy enough to get through—” She was up on the</p>\n<p>chimney-piece while she said this, though she hardly knew how she had got</p>\n<p>there. And certainly the glass</p>\n<p>was</p>\n<p>beginning to melt away, just like a</p>\n<p>bright silvery mist.</p>\n<p>In another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly down into</p>\n<p>the Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was to look whether there</p>\n<p>was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite pleased to find that there was a</p>\n<p>real one, blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind. “So I</p>\n<p>shall be as warm here as I was in the old room,” thought Alice:</p>\n<p>“warmer, in fact, because there’ll be no one here to scold me away</p>\n<p>from the fire. Oh, what fun it’ll be, when they see me through the glass</p>\n<p>in here, and can’t get at me!”</p>\n<p>Then she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from the old</p>\n<p>room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest was as different</p>\n<p>as possible. For instance, the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be</p>\n<p>all alive, and the very clock on the chimney-piece (you know you can only see</p>\n<p>the back of it in the Looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and</p>\n<p>grinned at her.</p>\n<p>“They don’t keep this room so tidy as the other,” Alice</p>\n<p>thought to herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth</p>\n<p>among the cinders: but in another moment, with a little “Oh!” of</p>\n<p>surprise, she was down on her hands and knees watching them. The chessmen were</p>\n<p>walking about, two and two!</p>\n<p>“Here are the Red King and the Red Queen,” Alice said (in a</p>\n<p>whisper, for fear of frightening them), “and there are the White King and</p>\n<p>the White Queen sitting on the edge of the shovel—and here are two</p>\n<p>castles walking arm in arm—I don’t think they can hear me,”</p>\n<p>she went on, as she put her head closer down, “and I’m nearly sure</p>\n<p>they can’t see me. I feel somehow as if I were invisible—”</p>\n<p>Here something began squeaking on the table behind Alice, and made her turn her</p>\n<p>head just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and begin kicking:</p>\n<p>she watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next.</p>\n<p>“It is the voice of my child!” the White Queen cried out as she</p>\n<p>rushed past the King, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders.</p>\n<p>“My precious Lily! My imperial kitten!” and she began scrambling</p>\n<p>wildly up the side of the fender.</p>\n<p>“Imperial fiddlestick!” said the King, rubbing his nose, which had</p>\n<p>been hurt by the fall. He had a right to be a</p>\n<p>little</p>\n<p>annoyed with the</p>\n<p>Queen, for he was covered with ashes from head to foot.</p>\n<p>Alice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little Lily was nearly</p>\n<p>screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the Queen and set her on</p>\n<p>the table by the side of her noisy little daughter.</p>\n<p>The Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had quite</p>\n<p>taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing but hug the</p>\n<p>little Lily in silence. As soon as she had recovered her breath a little, she</p>\n<p>called out to the White King, who was sitting sulkily among the ashes,</p>\n<p>“Mind the volcano!”</p>\n<p>“What volcano?” said the King, looking up anxiously into the fire,</p>\n<p>as if he thought that was the most likely place to find one.</p>\n<p>“Blew—me—up,” panted the Queen, who was still a little</p>\n<p>out of breath. “Mind you come up—the regular way—don’t</p>\n<p>get blown up!”</p>\n<p>Alice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar, till at</p>\n<p>last she said, “Why, you’ll be hours and hours getting to the</p>\n<p>table, at that rate. I’d far better help you, hadn’t I?” But</p>\n<p>the King took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could</p>\n<p>neither hear her nor see her.</p>\n<p>So Alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly than she</p>\n<p>had lifted the Queen, that she mightn’t take his breath away: but, before</p>\n<p>she put him on the table, she thought she might as well dust him a little, he</p>\n<p>was so covered with ashes.</p>\n<p>She said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face as the</p>\n<p>King made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible hand, and</p>\n<p>being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but his eyes and his</p>\n<p>mouth went on getting larger and larger, and rounder and rounder, till her hand</p>\n<p>shook so with laughing that she nearly let him drop upon the floor.</p>\n<p>“Oh!</p>\n<p>please</p>\n<p>don’t make such faces, my dear!” she cried</p>\n<p>out, quite forgetting that the King couldn’t hear her. “You make me</p>\n<p>laugh so that I can hardly hold you! And don’t keep your mouth so wide</p>\n<p>open! All the ashes will get into it—there, now I think you’re tidy</p>\n<p>enough!” she added, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table</p>\n<p>near the Queen.</p>\n<p>The King immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still: and Alice</p>\n<p>was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the room to see if</p>\n<p>she could find any water to throw over him. However, she could find nothing but</p>\n<p>a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it she found he had recovered, and</p>\n<p>he and the Queen were talking together in a frightened whisper—so low,</p>\n<p>that Alice could hardly hear what they said.</p>\n<p>The King was saying, “I assure, you my dear, I turned cold to the very</p>\n<p>ends of my whiskers!”</p>\n<p>To which the Queen replied, “You haven’t got any whiskers.”</p>\n<p>“The horror of that moment,” the King went on, “I shall</p>\n<p>never,</p>\n<p>never</p>\n<p>forget!”</p>\n<p>“You will, though,” the Queen said, “if you don’t make</p>\n<p>a memorandum of it.”</p>\n<p>Alice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous</p>\n<p>memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. A sudden thought struck</p>\n<p>her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some way over his</p>\n<p>shoulder, and began writing for him.</p>\n<p>The poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil for</p>\n<p>some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for him, and at</p>\n<p>last he panted out, “My dear! I really</p>\n<p>must</p>\n<p>get a thinner pencil.</p>\n<p>I can’t manage this one a bit; it writes all manner of things that I</p>\n<p>don’t intend—”</p>\n<p>“What manner of things?” said the Queen, looking over the book (in</p>\n<p>which Alice had put “</p>\n<p>The White Knight is sliding down the poker. He</p>\n<p>balances very badly</p>\n<p>”) “That’s not a memorandum of</p>\n<p>your</p>\n<p>feelings!”</p>\n<p>There was a book lying near Alice on the table, and while she sat watching the</p>\n<p>White King (for she was still a little anxious about him, and had the ink all</p>\n<p>ready to throw over him, in case he fainted again), she turned over the leaves,</p>\n<p>to find some part that she could read, “—for it’s all in some</p>\n<p>language I don’t know,” she said to herself.</p>\n<p>It was like this.</p>\n<p>.YKCOWREBBAJ</p>\n<p>sevot yhtils eht dna, gillirb sawT’</p>\n<p>ebaw eht ni elbmig dna eryg diD</p>\n<p>,sevogorob eht erew ysmim llA</p>\n<p>.ebargtuo shtar emom eht dnA</p>\n<p>She puzzled over this for some time, but at last a bright thought struck her.</p>\n<p>“Why, it’s a Looking-glass book, of course! And if I hold it up to</p>\n<p>a glass, the words will all go the right way again.”</p>\n<p>This was the poem that Alice read.</p>\n<p>JABBERWOCKY.</p>\n<p>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</p>\n<p>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;</p>\n<p>All mimsy were the borogoves,</p>\n<p>And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>\n<p>“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!</p>\n<p>The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!</p>\n<p>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun</p>\n<p>The frumious Bandersnatch!”</p>\n<p>He took his vorpal sword in hand:</p>\n<p>Long time the manxome foe he sought—</p>\n<p>So rested he by the Tumtum tree,</p>\n<p>And stood awhile in thought.</p>\n<p>And as in uffish thought he stood,</p>\n<p>The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,</p>\n<p>Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,</p>\n<p>And burbled as it came!</p>\n<p>One, two! One, two! And through and through</p>\n<p>The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!</p>\n<p>He left it dead, and with its head</p>\n<p>He went galumphing back.</p>\n<p>“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?</p>\n<p>Come to my arms, my beamish boy!</p>\n<p>O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”</p>\n<p>He chortled in his joy.</p>\n<p>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</p>\n<p>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;</p>\n<p>All mimsy were the borogoves,</p>\n<p>And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>\n<p>“It seems very pretty,” she said when she had finished it,</p>\n<p>“but it’s</p>\n<p>rather</p>\n<p>hard to understand!” (You see she</p>\n<p>didn’t like to confess, even to herself, that she couldn’t make it</p>\n<p>out at all.) “Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas—only I</p>\n<p>don’t exactly know what they are! However,</p>\n<p>somebody</p>\n<p>killed</p>\n<p>something</p>\n<p>: that’s clear, at any rate—”</p>\n<p>“But oh!” thought Alice, suddenly jumping up, “if I</p>\n<p>don’t make haste I shall have to go back through the Looking-glass,</p>\n<p>before I’ve seen what the rest of the house is like! Let’s have a</p>\n<p>look at the garden first!” She was out of the room in a moment, and ran</p>\n<p>down stairs—or, at least, it wasn’t exactly running, but a new</p>\n<p>invention of hers for getting down stairs quickly and easily, as Alice said to</p>\n<p>herself. She just kept the tips of her fingers on the hand-rail, and floated</p>\n<p>gently down without even touching the stairs with her feet; then she floated on</p>\n<p>through the hall, and would have gone straight out at the door in the same way,</p>\n<p>if she hadn’t caught hold of the door-post. She was getting a little</p>\n<p>giddy with so much floating in the air, and was rather glad to find herself</p>\n<p>walking again in the natural way.</p>\n"
