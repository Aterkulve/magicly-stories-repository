  "content": "<p>Mrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened, and\nNana entered, returned from her evening out. She growled and sprang at the boy,\nwho leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling screamed, this time in\ndistress for him, for she thought he was killed, and she ran down into the\nstreet to look for his little body, but it was not there; and she looked up,\nand in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought was a\nshooting star.</p>\n<p>She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her mouth, which\nproved to be the boy’s shadow. As he leapt at the window Nana had closed\nit quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had not had time to get out;\nslam went the window and snapped it off.</p>\n<p>You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was quite\nthe ordinary kind.</p>\n<p>Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow. She hung\nit out at the window, meaning “He is sure to come back for it; let us put\nit where he can get it easily without disturbing the children.”</p>\n<p>But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the window, it\nlooked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house. She thought\nof showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up winter great-coats for John\nand Michael, with a wet towel around his head to keep his brain clear, and it\nseemed a shame to trouble him; besides, she knew exactly what he would say:\n“It all comes of having a dog for a nurse.”</p>\n<p>She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer, until\na fitting opportunity came for telling her husband. Ah me!</p>\n<p>The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten Friday. Of\ncourse it was a Friday.</p>\n<p>“I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday,” she used to\nsay afterwards to her husband, while perhaps Nana was on the other side of her,\nholding her hand.</p>\n<p>“No, no,” Mr. Darling always said, “I am responsible for it\nall. I, George Darling, did it.Mea culpa, mea culpa.” He had had\na classical education.</p>\n<p>They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every detail\nof it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other side like the\nfaces on a bad coinage.</p>\n<p>“If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27,” Mrs.\nDarling said.</p>\n<p>“If only I had not poured my medicine into Nana’s bowl,” said\nMr. Darling.</p>\n<p>“If only I had pretended to like the medicine,” was what\nNana’s wet eyes said.</p>\n<p>“My liking for parties, George.”</p>\n<p>“My fatal gift of humour, dearest.”</p>\n<p>“My touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress.”</p>\n<p>Then one or more of them would break down altogether; Nana at the thought,\n“It’s true, it’s true, they ought not to have had a dog for a\nnurse.” Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to\nNana’s eyes.</p>\n<p>“That fiend!” Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana’s bark was the\necho of it, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was something in the\nright-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names.</p>\n<p>They would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every smallest\ndetail of that dreadful evening. It had begun so uneventfully, so precisely\nlike a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the water for\nMichael’s bath and carrying him to it on her back.</p>\n<p>“I won’t go to bed,” he had shouted, like one who still\nbelieved that he had the last word on the subject, “I won’t, I\nwon’t. Nana, it isn’t six o’clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, I\nshan’t love you any more, Nana. I tell you I won’t be bathed, I\nwon’t, I won’t!”</p>\n<p>Then Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown. She had dressed\nearly because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown, with the necklace\nGeorge had given her. She was wearing Wendy’s bracelet on her arm; she\nhad asked for the loan of it. Wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mother.</p>\n<p>She had found her two older children playing at being herself and father on the\noccasion of Wendy’s birth, and John was saying:</p>\n<p>“I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a\nmother,” in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the\nreal occasion.</p>\n<p>Wendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done.</p>\n<p>Then John was born, with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the birth of a\nmale, and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also, but John said\nbrutally that they did not want any more.</p>\n<p>Michael had nearly cried. “Nobody wants me,” he said, and of course\nthe lady in the evening-dress could not stand that.</p>\n<p>“I do,” she said, “I so want a third child.”</p>\n<p>“Boy or girl?” asked Michael, not too hopefully.</p>\n<p>“Boy.”</p>\n<p>Then he had leapt into her arms. Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs. Darling\nand Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was to be Michael’s\nlast night in the nursery.</p>\n<p>They go on with their recollections.</p>\n<p>“It was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn’t it?” Mr.\nDarling would say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been like a tornado.</p>\n<p>Perhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been dressing for the\nparty, and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie. It is an\nastounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though he knew about stocks and\nshares, had no real mastery of his tie. Sometimes the thing yielded to him\nwithout a contest, but there were occasions when it would have been better for\nthe house if he had swallowed his pride and used a made-up tie.</p>\n<p>This was such an occasion. He came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled\nlittle brute of a tie in his hand.</p>\n<p>“Why, what is the matter, father dear?”</p>\n<p>“Matter!” he yelled; he really yelled. “This tie, it will not\ntie.” He became dangerously sarcastic. “Not round my neck! Round\nthe bed-post! Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, but\nround my neck, no! Oh dear no! begs to be excused!”</p>\n<p>He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he went on sternly,\n“I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my neck we\ndon’t go out to dinner to-night, and if I don’t go out to dinner\nto-night, I never go to the office again, and if I don’t go to the office\nagain, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into the\nstreets.”</p>\n<p>Even then Mrs. Darling was placid. “Let me try, dear,” she said,\nand indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do, and with her nice cool\nhands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood around to see their\nfate decided. Some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily,\nbut Mr. Darling had far too fine a nature for that; he thanked her carelessly,\nat once forgot his rage, and in another moment was dancing round the room with\nMichael on his back.</p>\n<p>“How wildly we romped!” says Mrs. Darling now, recalling it.</p>\n<p>“Our last romp!” Mr. Darling groaned.</p>\n<p>“O George, do you remember Michael suddenly said to me, ‘How did\nyou get to know me, mother?’”</p>\n<p>“I remember!”</p>\n<p>“They were rather sweet, don’t you think, George?”</p>\n<p>“And they were ours, ours! and now they are gone.”</p>\n<p>The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most unluckily Mr. Darling\ncollided against her, covering his trousers with hairs. They were not only new\ntrousers, but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them, and he\nhad had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming. Of course Mrs. Darling\nbrushed him, but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog\nfor a nurse.</p>\n<p>“George, Nana is a treasure.”</p>\n<p>“No doubt, but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the\nchildren as puppies.”</p>\n<p>“Oh no, dear one, I feel sure she knows they have souls.”</p>\n<p>“I wonder,” Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, “I wonder.”\nIt was an opportunity, his wife felt, for telling him about the boy. At first\nhe pooh-poohed the story, but he became thoughtful when she showed him the\nshadow.</p>\n<p>“It is nobody I know,” he said, examining it carefully, “but\nit does look a scoundrel.”</p>\n<p>“We were still discussing it, you remember,” says Mr. Darling,\n“when Nana came in with Michael’s medicine. You will never carry\nthe bottle in your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault.”</p>\n<p>Strong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved rather\nfoolishly over the medicine. If he had a weakness, it was for thinking that all\nhis life he had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when Michael dodged the\nspoon in Nana’s mouth, he had said reprovingly, “Be a man,\nMichael.”</p>\n<p>“Won’t; won’t!” Michael cried naughtily. Mrs. Darling\nleft the room to get a chocolate for him, and Mr. Darling thought this showed\nwant of firmness.</p>\n<p>“Mother, don’t pamper him,” he called after her.\n“Michael, when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur. I said,\n‘Thank you, kind parents, for giving me bottles to make me\nwell.’”</p>\n<p>He really thought this was true, and Wendy, who was now in her night-gown,\nbelieved it also, and she said, to encourage Michael, “That medicine you\nsometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn’t it?”</p>\n<p>“Ever so much nastier,” Mr. Darling said bravely, “and I\nwould take it now as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn’t lost the\nbottle.”</p>\n<p>He had not exactly lost it; he had climbed in the dead of night to the top of\nthe wardrobe and hidden it there. What he did not know was that the faithful\nLiza had found it, and put it back on his wash-stand.</p>\n<p>“I know where it is, father,” Wendy cried, always glad to be of\nservice. “I’ll bring it,” and she was off before he could\nstop her. Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way.</p>\n<p>“John,” he said, shuddering, “it’s most beastly stuff.\nIt’s that nasty, sticky, sweet kind.”</p>\n<p>“It will soon be over, father,” John said cheerily, and then in\nrushed Wendy with the medicine in a glass.</p>\n<p>“I have been as quick as I could,” she panted.</p>\n<p>“You have been wonderfully quick,” her father retorted, with a\nvindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her. “Michael\nfirst,” he said doggedly.</p>\n<p>“Father first,” said Michael, who was of a suspicious nature.</p>\n<p>“I shall be sick, you know,” Mr. Darling said threateningly.</p>\n<p>“Come on, father,” said John.</p>\n<p>“Hold your tongue, John,” his father rapped out.</p>\n<p>Wendy was quite puzzled. “I thought you took it quite easily,\nfather.”</p>\n<p>“That is not the point,” he retorted. “The point is, that\nthere is more in my glass than in Michael’s spoon.” His proud heart\nwas nearly bursting. “And it isn’t fair: I would say it though it\nwere with my last breath; it isn’t fair.”</p>\n<p>“Father, I am waiting,” said Michael coldly.</p>\n<p>“It’s all very well to say you are waiting; so am I waiting.”</p>\n<p>“Father’s a cowardly custard.”</p>\n<p>“So are you a cowardly custard.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not frightened.”</p>\n<p>“Neither am I frightened.”</p>\n<p>“Well, then, take it.”</p>\n<p>“Well, then, you take it.”</p>\n<p>Wendy had a splendid idea. “Why not both take it at the same time?”</p>\n<p>“Certainly,” said Mr. Darling. “Are you ready,\nMichael?”</p>\n<p>Wendy gave the words, one, two, three, and Michael took his medicine, but Mr.\nDarling slipped his behind his back.</p>\n<p>There was a yell of rage from Michael, and “O father!” Wendy\nexclaimed.</p>\n<p>“What do you mean by ‘O father’?” Mr. Darling demanded.\n“Stop that row, Michael. I meant to take mine, but I—I missed\nit.”</p>\n<p>It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him, just as if they did\nnot admire him. “Look here, all of you,” he said entreatingly, as\nsoon as Nana had gone into the bathroom. “I have just thought of a\nsplendid joke. I shall pour my medicine into Nana’s bowl, and she will\ndrink it, thinking it is milk!”</p>\n<p>It was the colour of milk; but the children did not have their father’s\nsense of humour, and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the medicine\ninto Nana’s bowl. “What fun!” he said doubtfully, and they\ndid not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned.</p>\n<p>“Nana, good dog,” he said, patting her, “I have put a little\nmilk into your bowl, Nana.”</p>\n<p>Nana wagged her tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it. Then she gave\nMr. Darling such a look, not an angry look: she showed him the great red tear\nthat makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into her kennel.</p>\n<p>Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not give in. In a\nhorrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl. “O George,” she said,\n“it’s your medicine!”</p>\n<p>“It was only a joke,” he roared, while she comforted her boys, and\nWendy hugged Nana. “Much good,” he said bitterly, “my wearing\nmyself to the bone trying to be funny in this house.”</p>\n<p>And still Wendy hugged Nana. “That’s right,” he shouted.\n“Coddle her! Nobody coddles me. Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner,\nwhy should I be coddled—why, why, why!”</p>\n<p>“George,” Mrs. Darling entreated him, “not so loud; the\nservants will hear you.” Somehow they had got into the way of calling\nLiza the servants.</p>\n<p>“Let them!” he answered recklessly. “Bring in the whole\nworld. But I refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour\nlonger.”</p>\n<p>The children wept, and Nana ran to him beseechingly, but he waved her back. He\nfelt he was a strong man again. “In vain, in vain,” he cried;\n“the proper place for you is the yard, and there you go to be tied up\nthis instant.”</p>\n<p>“George, George,” Mrs. Darling whispered, “remember what I\ntold you about that boy.”</p>\n<p>Alas, he would not listen. He was determined to show who was master in that\nhouse, and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel, he lured her out\nof it with honeyed words, and seizing her roughly, dragged her from the\nnursery. He was ashamed of himself, and yet he did it. It was all owing to his\ntoo affectionate nature, which craved for admiration. When he had tied her up\nin the back-yard, the wretched father went and sat in the passage, with his\nknuckles to his eyes.</p>\n<p>In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silence\nand lit their night-lights. They could hear Nana barking, and John whimpered,\n“It is because he is chaining her up in the yard,” but Wendy was\nwiser.</p>\n<p>“That is not Nana’s unhappy bark,” she said, little guessing\nwhat was about to happen; “that is her bark when she smells\ndanger.”</p>\n<p>Danger!</p>\n<p>“Are you sure, Wendy?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>\n<p>Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened. She\nlooked out, and the night was peppered with stars. They were crowding round the\nhouse, as if curious to see what was to take place there, but she did not\nnotice this, nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her. Yet a\nnameless fear clutched at her heart and made her cry, “Oh, how I wish\nthat I wasn’t going to a party to-night!”</p>\n<p>Even Michael, already half asleep, knew that she was perturbed, and he asked,\n“Can anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights are lit?”</p>\n<p>“Nothing, precious,” she said; “they are the eyes a mother\nleaves behind her to guard her children.”</p>\n<p>She went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and little Michael\nflung his arms round her. “Mother,” he cried, “I’m glad\nof you.” They were the last words she was to hear from him for a long\ntime.</p>\n<p>No. 27 was only a few yards distant, but there had been a slight fall of snow,\nand Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it deftly not to soil their\nshoes. They were already the only persons in the street, and all the stars were\nwatching them. Stars are beautiful, but they may not take an active part in\nanything, they must just look on for ever. It is a punishment put on them for\nsomething they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was. So the older\nones have become glassy-eyed and seldom speak (winking is the star language),\nbut the little ones still wonder. They are not really friendly to Peter, who\nhad a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out;\nbut they are so fond of fun that they were on his side to-night, and anxious to\nget the grown-ups out of the way. So as soon as the door of 27 closed on Mr.\nand Mrs. Darling there was a commotion in the firmament, and the smallest of\nall the stars in the Milky Way screamed out:</p>\n<p>“Now, Peter!”</p>"
